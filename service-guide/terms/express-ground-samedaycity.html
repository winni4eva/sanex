<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>These FedEx Express Terms and Conditions, contained in the FedEx Service Guide, supersede all previous terms and conditions, amendments, supplements, and other prior statements concerning the rates and conditions of FedEx Express service to which these terms and conditions apply. The contract of carriage as expressed in these terms and conditions constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all previous agreements and understandings, whether oral or written, between the parties or any agents, affiliates or subcontractors thereof (including FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. and its agents, affiliates and employees [&quot;FedEx Office&quot;]) with respect to the subject matter hereof, and each party warrants that it has not relied and will not be relying upon any evaluation, representation or advice from the other party, its agents, affiliates or subcontractors (including any agents, affiliates or employees of FedEx Office) except representations expressly made in writing in these terms and conditions. The downloadable version (PDF) of the FedEx Express Terms and Conditions at fedex.com on the date of shipment is controlling.</p>
<p>The FedEx Service Guide consists of the service information at fedex.com/serviceguide and the overview of services in the downloadable FedEx Service Guide (U.S. and U.S. export); U.S., U.S. export, U.S. import and U.S. retail rates; these FedEx Express Terms and Conditions; the FedEx Ground Tariff; and the FedEx SameDay City Tariff. The service information at fedex.com/serviceguide (excluding rates, the FedEx Express Terms and Conditions, the FedEx Ground Tariff, and the FedEx SameDay City Tariff) and the overview of services in the downloadable FedEx Service Guide are not part of the contract of carriage. FedEx reserves the right to unilaterally modify, amend, change or supplement the FedEx Service Guide, including, but not limited to, the rates, services, features of service, and these terms and conditions, without notice. Only an officer in the Legal Department of FedEx Corporation or successor positions may authorize a supplement to, or modification, change or amendment of, the FedEx Service Guide. No other agent or employee of FedEx, its affiliates or subsidiaries, nor any other person or party, is authorized to do so. This restriction in modification does not apply to a modification applicable to a single customer and included in a FedEx Sales or FedEx Customer Automation agreement. To the extent a conflict exists between a FedEx Sales or FedEx Customer Automation agreement and these FedEx Express Terms and Conditions, the FedEx Sales or FedEx Customer Automation agreement controls.</p>
<p>Any failure to enforce or apply a term, condition, or provision of the FedEx Service Guide shall not constitute a waiver of that term, condition or provision or otherwise impair our right to enforce or apply such a term, condition or provision in the future.</p>
<p><b>U.S. Shipments</b><br />
The following pages contain the FedEx Express Terms and Conditions applicable to the transportation of any package, document, envelope, skid, container or other item by FedEx Express U.S. Services (including FedEx SameDay, FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight, FedEx Standard Overnight, FedEx 2Day A.M., FedEx 2Day, FedEx Express Saver, FedEx SameDay Freight, FedEx First Overnight Freight, FedEx 1Day Freight, FedEx 2Day Freight and FedEx 3Day Freight), including, but not limited to, any such items tendered by customers utilizing FedEx electronic shipping systems, manifests, airbills, labels, shipping software and stamps when shipping between points within the U.S., including Hawaii and Alaska. See the International Shipments section when shipping to or from international points, including points between Puerto Rico and the U.S. See the FedEx Ground Tariff when shipping by FedEx Ground and the FedEx SameDay City Tariff when shipping by FedEx SameDay City.</p>
<p>If there is a conflict between these terms and conditions and the terms and conditions on any FedEx airbill, manifest, stamp, shipping label or other transit documentation, the terms and conditions in the FedEx Service Guide, as amended, modified, changed or supplemented, will control.</p>
<p>Rates and service quotations by our employees and agents are based upon information you provide, but final rates and service may vary based upon the shipment actually tendered and the application of these terms and conditions. Rates quoted will vary depending on whether (1) the shipper is a FedEx account holder and (2) the shipper has discounts applied to his or her account.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shippers will be quoted FedEx Standard List Rates if they have a valid FedEx account, do not have discounts applied to their account and if they charge their shipping to their account.</li>
<li>Shippers will be quoted Account-Specific Rates if they have a valid FedEx account, have discounts applied to their account and if they charge their shipping to their account.</li>
<li>Shippers will be quoted FedEx Retail Rates for shipments originating in the U.S. that are paid for by cash, check, debit or credit card instead of being charged to a valid FedEx account.</li>
<li>Shippers may request FedEx One Rate pricing for qualifying FedEx Express shipments as an alternative to FedEx Standard List Rates, Account-Specific Rates or FedEx Retail Rates. See the FedEx One Rate information in the Find Your Rate section of this Service Guide for details.</li>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>All shipments originating in the U.S. and paid for with cash, check, debit or credit card must be tendered at a staffed shipping location, and will be charged FedEx Retail Rates.</p>
<p>For transactions other than &quot;Bill Sender,&quot; &quot;Bill Recipient&quot; or &quot;Bill Third Party,&quot; you must pay by cash (not accepted at all FedEx locations), check, money order or credit card. Payment is required when you give us your package. For &quot;Bill Sender&quot; and &quot;Bill Third Party&quot; transactions, packages will not be accepted unless you provide a valid FedEx account number. For &quot;Bill Recipient&quot; transactions, packages can be tendered without payment, but in order for the package to be delivered, the recipient must provide a valid FedEx account number or pay with cash, check or money order at time of delivery. If the recipient refuses to pay, the package will be treated as undeliverable and the sender will be responsible for all transportation charges and other fees, including all special handling fees.<br />
</p>
<p>For customers utilizing our electronic systems, a valid FedEx account number is required for &quot;Bill Sender,&quot; &quot;Bill Recipient&quot; or &quot;Bill Third Party&quot; transactions.<br />
<br />
Account numbers are issued by FedEx according to shipping location and are nontransferable. Account numbers are issued and used solely at the discretion of FedEx. FedEx may discontinue the use of accounts, in whole or in part, and terminate all or particular accounts and account numbers at any time, for any reason, at its sole discretion. Improper, illegal or any other misuse of your FedEx account may also, at the sole discretion of FedEx, result in loss of discounts or termination of the account. Improper, illegal or other misuse includes, but is not limited to, ordering supplies for any purpose other than shipping with FedEx, unauthorized consolidation of shipments owned by different parties, or violations of the terms and conditions in this FedEx Service Guide. If your account has been compromised or stolen, the account may be closed and you may be issued a new account. However, you will be responsible for all valid charges on the closed account. Any supplies, materials, rights or privileges that you acquire by holding a FedEx account number may not be used for any purpose other than shipping with FedEx, and FedEx may seek damages against you for any improper, illegal or other misuse of your account. If your account is terminated, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to deny your application for new or additional FedEx account numbers at any time in the future. Except for Canada- and Puerto Rico-based accounts, international account numbers may not be used for shipments between two points within the U.S. All charges will be billed and must be remitted in U.S. funds. <br />
<br />
Any individual or entity that uses the FedEx account or shipping discounts of another FedEx account holder without authorization will be charged Standard List Rates for all such shipments without prior notice. This includes all shipments, whether they are classified as “Bill Sender,” “Bill Recipient” or “Bill Third Party,” or any other method of billing. Unauthorized use includes, but is not limited to, using the shipping discount of another FedEx account holder without the knowledge and permission of both FedEx and the account holder.<br />
<br />
All requests for account numbers are subject to credit investigation and verification by our Credit Department and Customer Account Confirmation Department. FedEx utilizes business credit reporting agencies, audited financial statements, Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's bond ratings, and other sources as necessary, to determine eligibility for open credit terms. FedEx does not offer consumer credit privileges. Any individual shipping for personal use must prepay the shipment charges or establish a FedEx account for billing directly to a major credit card. Stored-value cards or gift cards cannot be used to open an account; however, such cards may be used for payment when tendering a package at staffed FedEx shipping locations, and in conjunction with our credit card acceptance policy. If your FedEx account is billed directly to a credit card, you agree to the following terms: (1) you authorize FedEx to initiate variable charges to the credit card to settle charges payable to FedEx; (2) you authorize FedEx to charge your card for any unpaid amounts on your account; (3) you authorize the card issuer to pay any amounts associated with your account without requiring a signed receipt; (4) you agree to keep your card information current (FedEx may receive updates on your card information from participating issuing banks and may update your account profile to avoid service disruptions); (5) you agree that FedEx shall have no liability for any insufficient funds or other charges incurred from attempts to charge and/or place holds on your card; and (6) your agreement to these terms and conditions is to be accepted as authorization to the card issuer to pay all amounts associated with your account. <br />
<br />
The party to whom a FedEx account number is issued is liable for all charges to the account, including those resulting from unauthorized use. The account holder is responsible for the safekeeping of the account number. The account number should be released only to those authorized to ship on the account.<br />
<br />
Failure to keep your FedEx account current may result in your account being placed on a cash-only status. Use of an account on cash-only status may result in your package being delayed, rejected or returned until arrangements for payment are completed. If the account number to be billed is not valid, the shipment may be delayed until an alternative form of payment is secured. If a package is held or delivery is otherwise delayed because the account is not in good credit standing, you will not be entitled to a refund or credit of your transportation charges under the Service Failure Money-Back Guarantee Policy.<br />
<br />
You must use your FedEx account number to obtain any discount applicable to your account. Use of your account number constitutes your agreement that all packages shipped by us shall be subject to these terms and conditions, as modified, amended or supplemented.<br />
<br />
FedEx may provide trade credit information on its account holders to credit bureaus.</p>

FedEx Express may accept certain shipments of live animals such as horses, livestock and zoo animals (to and from zoo locations only) on an exception basis if approved and coordinated by the FedEx Animal Desk (call <a href="tel:18004059052">1.800.405.9052</a>). <br />
<br />
If approved by FedEx, we may accept non-venomous reptiles, amphibians, live/tropical fish and beneficial insects on an exception basis under the following conditions:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     Shipments must be from a business to a business (from a breeder to a pet store, for example).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     The shipper must have its packaging tested and pre-approved by FedEx Packaging Design and Development for the type of animal being shipped. Call <a href="tel:18006337019">1.800.633.7019</a> for assistance. It is the responsibility of the shipper to adequately package shipments for all temperature extremes and handling conditions.</p>
<p>B.    FedEx Express does not accept animal carcass shipments as part of its regular-scheduled service. FedEx Express may accept certain shipments of animal heads and other parts for taxidermy if properly packaged.<br />
<br />
If approved by FedEx, we may accept animal carcasses, organs and other parts on an exception basis under the following conditions:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     Shipments must be approved by the FedEx Animal Desk (call <a href="tel:18004059052">1.800.405.9052</a>).</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.<b> &quot;Bill Sender&quot;</b> means charges will be billed to the sender. The sender's FedEx account number must appear on the airbill, and the account must be in good credit standing. The sender may request an initial rebilling to another party, but all subsequent rebills will be only to the sender. (See section H, Billing and Special Handling Fees.)</p>
<p>B. <b>&quot;Bill Recipient&quot;</b> means charges will be billed to the recipient. (This is not C.O.D. service.) The recipient's FedEx account number must be provided on the airbill at the time of shipment, or by the recipient at the time of delivery, and must be in good credit standing. If an account number in good credit standing is not provided, the recipient must pay for the shipment at the time of delivery.</p>
<p>C. <b>&quot;Bill Third Party&quot;</b> means charges will be billed to someone other than the sender or recipient. Charges for shipments within the U.S. may be billed only to a third party in the U.S. In order to choose this billing option, the FedEx account number of the third party must appear on the airbill at the time it is tendered and the account must be in good credit standing.</p>
<p>D. We reserve the right to verify the method of payment for any shipment and to refuse any shipment for which the method of payment cannot be verified.</p>
<p>E. FedEx may consider payment type in determining pricing and discounts, and reserves the right to adjust discounts based on payment type.</p>
<p>F. For packages tendered for transportation with a FedEx Express Prepaid Stamp, FedEx reserves the right to bill the customer for packages that are overweight or require special handling. FedEx Express Prepaid Stamps are nonrefundable and nontransferable.</p>
<p>G. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE GIVEN TO FEDEX, THE SENDER IS ULTIMATELY LIABLE FOR, WILL BE BILLED FOR AND AGREES TO PAY ALL CHARGES AND FEES, INCLUDING ANY SPECIAL HANDLING FEES, IF THE RECIPIENT OR THIRD PARTY FAILS OR REFUSES TO PAY. For FedEx returns shipments, please see Return Options.</p>
<p>H. <b>Billing and Special Handling Fees:</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     A special handling fee will be charged when no account number appears on the airbill or when an incomplete, inaccurate or invalid account number appears on the airbill in &quot;Bill Sender,&quot; &quot;Bill Recipient&quot; or &quot;Bill Third Party&quot; transactions. If a &quot;Bill Sender,&quot; &quot;Bill Recipient&quot; or &quot;Bill Third Party&quot; package is received without a FedEx account number, we will attempt to determine the correct account from our records and bill the account for all charges and fees, plus the special handling fee. Any applicable discount will apply. If, however, we cannot determine the correct account, the transportation charges plus the special handling fee will be billed directly to the sender, and no discount will be allowed. See Rates in the FedEx Service Guide for details.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     Payer Rebilling. A special handling fee will be charged to the sender for each request for a change to billing instructions for a package. We will accept requests for change to billing instructions up to 90 days from the invoice date.<br />
<br />
Requests for rebilling of transportation charges must be received via one of the approved channels:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">a.     Submit your request through the Non-Pay option with Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) if you are a registered user; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">b.     Use our internet application FedEx Billing Online at fedex.com if you are a registered user; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">c.     Submit your request via fedex.com/us/customersupport/email/express_ground.html (select Billing/Invoicing as the category). Your request for a rebill of transportation charges must include the current invoice number, the FedEx tracking number, amount and the new FedEx account number that you want to rebill; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">d.     Submit the request via our automated interactive voice response system at <a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a> (say &quot;billing&quot;). Your request for a rebill of transportation charges must include your FedEx account number, if any, the current invoice number, the FedEx tracking number and the new FedEx account number that you want to rebill.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     A $20 special handling fee will be charged to you for any check or electronic funds transfer that is dishonored for any reason.</p>
<p>I. Electronically captured data will be used for billing purposes in the event a billing copy of the airbill is not available at the time of billing.</p>
<p>J. Your payment must be accompanied by the remittance data that supports the payment. Remittance data must include the FedEx invoice number and the associated amount(s) being paid on the FedEx invoice. Payment at the airbill level or tracking-number level must be transmitted to FedEx via electronic data interchange (EDI) — see the EDI section below.</p>
<p>Payment should be sent using your remittance advice to one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     Default Billing. Senders are solely responsible for accurately completing all sections of the airbill and for the entry of accurate shipment information into any electronic shipping device. If you fail to provide or correctly enter this information, you will be billed and agree to pay based on our estimate of the number of packages transported and either the dimensional weight at the time of billing or a standard default weight-per-package estimate, both of which will be determined by us at our sole discretion. If no service is marked, we will send your shipment via FedEx Priority Overnight or FedEx 1Day Freight, whichever is applicable.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     Our money-back guarantee policy governs and is the exclusive remedy for requests for refunds or credits related to service failures. (See the Money-Back Guarantee Policy section for applicable notice provisions and other conditions.) If the money-back guarantee is suspended or revoked, there is no remedy.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     Requests for invoice adjustments due to an overcharge must be received within 60 days after the original invoice date (or ship date if prepaid by cash, check, money order or credit card).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.     FedEx is not obligated to refund any overcharge or pay any other obligation owed when your FedEx account is, or has been in the past, more than 60 days past due.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.     If your account is more than 60 days past due, FedEx may, at its sole discretion, apply any overcharge amounts or other overpayments it agrees are owed to you against the oldest invoices.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">7.     You may request an invoice adjustment for reasons not related to a service failure in the following ways:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">a.     Use our internet application FedEx Billing Online at fedex.com if you are a registered user; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">b.     Submit your request through the invoice adjustment feature at fedex.com; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">c.     Submit the request via fedex.com/us/customersupport/email/express_ground.html (select Billing/Invoicing as the category). All adjustment requests must state the reason an adjustment or refund is warranted and must provide the following: the FedEx account number (if any); the FedEx tracking number; and the date of shipment; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">d.     Submit the request via our telephone invoice adjustment system at <a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a> (say &quot;billing&quot;). If you choose to submit your request via the telephone invoice adjustment system, the request must state the reason an adjustment or refund is warranted and must provide the following: the FedEx account number (if any); the FedEx tracking number; and the date of shipment; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">e.     Send your request to:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">FedEx<br />
Revenue Services<br />
3965 Airways Boulevard<br />
Module G<br />
Memphis, TN 38116</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">f.     You may also send your request via fax to the FedEx toll-free fax service: <b>1.800.548.3020</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">A partial payment against an invoice is not considered a request for invoice adjustment or notice of a refund request.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">8.     We will not be liable for any invoice adjustment unless you comply with the notice requirements described above. The filing of a lawsuit against us does not constitute compliance with these notice provisions.<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">For additional information or assistance regarding billing issues, contact Revenue Services at <a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a> (say &quot;billing&quot;), 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. (CST), Monday through Friday.</p>
<p>N. <b>Additional Taxes.</b> If a federal value-added, consumption or similar tax is applicable to your shipment, we reserve the right to add that amount to your shipping charges without notice. We pay any applicable federal excise tax on the air transportation portion of our service.</p>
<p>O. The shipper and any other party who is liable for payment are responsible for all reasonable costs incurred by FedEx in obtaining or attempting to obtain payment for services rendered by us. Such costs include, but are not limited to, attorneys' fees, collection agency fees, interest and court costs.</p>
<p>P. At our sole discretion, FedEx may transfer and assign ownership of, and any rights to collect, any and all charges due and payable to us.</p>
<p>Q. FedEx will charge for the category of service selected by the shipper, notwithstanding any requests for a different delivery time or date, including but not limited to, requests made by the recipient using FedEx Delivery Manager.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>We provide pickup and delivery service to points within our primary service areas. Service outside our primary service areas may be provided through cartage agents. For more information, please call Customer Service at<b> </b><a>1.800.463.3339</a> or Express Freight Customer Service at <a href="tel:18003320807">1.800.332.0807</a>.</p>
<p>A. Our delivery commitment time and money-back guarantee policy apply only to the portion of the transportation handled directly by us (see the Money-Back Guarantee Policy section). The delivery commitment time begins when the cartage agent tenders the shipment to us and ends when a shipment is available for pickup by you or a cartage agent. Our tender of a shipment to a cartage agent constitutes delivery of the shipment by us for all purposes. Except as stated below for FedEx Express Freight shipments, we are not responsible for service failures as a result of cartage agent pickups or deliveries.</p>
<p>B. For FedEx Express Freight shipments destined to extended service areas (H4, H5, H6) and when FedEx arranges delivery by a cartage agent, our delivery commitment time and money-back guarantee policy apply to both the portion of the transportation handled directly by us and to the portion of the transportation handled by the cartage agent. (See the Money-Back Guarantee Policy section.) For FedEx Express Freight shipments originating in extended service areas (H4, H5, H6, H7) the delivery commitment time begins when the cartage agent tenders the shipment to FedEx.</p>
<p>C. For FedEx Express Freight shipments destined to H7 extended service areas, our delivery commitment time and money-back guarantee policy apply only to the portion of the transportation handled directly by us. The delivery commitment time ends when a shipment is available at the FedEx location for pickup by you or a cartage agent. We are not responsible for service failures as a result of cartage agent pickups from, or deliveries to, H7 extended service areas.</p>
<p>D. If you elect to make arrangements for pickup or delivery directly with a cartage agent, you are responsible for all charges and fees assessed by the cartage agent. The invoice you receive from us will reflect only our charges and fees.</p>
<p>E. A special handling fee applies; see Rates in the FedEx Service Guide.</p>
<p>F. Cartage agents are independent contractors. They are neither employees nor agents of FedEx Express, and we are not responsible for any of their acts or omissions.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A. We must receive notice of a claim due to failure to properly collect or deliver a C.O.D. payment within 21 calendar days after delivery of the shipment. We must receive notice of a claim due to damage (visible or concealed), delay (including spoilage claims) or shortage within 60 calendar days after delivery of the shipment. (See the Money-Back Guarantee Policy section for the time period to request a refund or credit of transportation charges due to a service failure.) We must receive notice of all other claims, including, but not limited to, claims for nondelivery or misdelivery, within nine months after the package was tendered to FedEx Express for shipment.</p>
<p>B. Notice of claims for which you are seeking more than US$100 must be in writing. All claims must be made within the time limits set forth previously.</p>
<p>C. Your notice of claim must include complete shipper and recipient information, as well as the FedEx tracking number, date of shipment, number of pieces, and shipment weight. Failure to provide us with notice in the manner and within the time limits set forth in paragraphs (A) through (B) will result in denial of your claim, and we will have no liability or obligation to pay your claim. The filing of a lawsuit does not constitute compliance with these notice provisions.</p>
<p>D. Written documentation supporting the amount of your claim must be delivered to us within nine months after the package was tendered to FedEx Express for shipment. Such documentation may include original purchase invoices, estimates or invoices for repair, expense statements, appraisals, final confirmation screen if online order with proof of payment, or other records. These documents must be verifiable to our satisfaction.</p>
<p>E. We are not obligated to act on any claim until all transportation charges have been paid. The claim amount may not be deducted from these charges or from any outstanding balance owed to us.</p>
<p>F. FedEx reserves the right to inspect a damaged shipment on the recipient's premises as well as the right to retrieve the damaged package for inspection at a FedEx facility. The terms and conditions applicable to the original shipment (including any declared value) will govern the disposition of all claims in connection with the shipment, including any claim relative to the retrieval, inspection or return of the package. When a package is picked up for inspection, a receipt for the damaged package will be provided if requested by the recipient. All of the original shipping cartons, packing and contents must be made available for our inspection and retained until the claim is concluded. FedEx reserves the right to request a self-inspection requiring proof of damage in the form of photographs of the carton, inner packaging and damaged contents. If requested, this documentation must be delivered to us within nine months after the package was tendered to FedEx Express for shipment.</p>
<p>G. Except in the case of concealed damage, receipt of the shipment by the recipient without written notice of damage on the airbill is prima facie evidence that the shipment was delivered in good condition.</p>
<p>H. We do not accept claims from customers whose packages were tendered to FedEx through a package consolidator. (See the Package Consolidators [Including FedEx Authorized ShipCenters] section.)</p>
<p>I. Shipment-status information is not intended or permitted to be used as the basis to file a claim.</p>
<p>J. Only one claim can be filed in connection with a shipment. Acceptance of payment of a claim shall extinguish any right to recover in connection with that shipment.</p>
<p>K. When we resolve a claim by paying full value for a shipment, we reserve the right to pick up the package for salvage, and all rights, title to, and interest in the package shall vest with us.</p>
<p>L. You can file a claim in the following ways:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     Submit claims online at fedex.com/us/claimsonline.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     Send written claims, including the completed claim form and supporting documentation, via the U.S. Postal Service or fax to:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;"><br />
FedEx Cargo Claims Department<br />
P.O. Box 256<br />
Pittsburgh, PA 15230<br />
Fax: <b>1.877.229.4766</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">If you fax your completed claim form and supporting documentation, FedEx will send you a confirmation letter by return fax.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3. Call customer service at <a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a> (say &quot;claims&quot;) to obtain a case number for your claim, then complete a print copy of the claim form. You may have to submit supporting documentation using FedEx Claims Online or the mailing address or fax number listed above.</p>
<p>M. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THE ABOVE CONDITIONS WILL RESULT IN THE DENIAL OF YOUR CLAIM.</p>

<input id="justifyRteRtl" type="hidden" value="false"/>


<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    We offer a collect-on-delivery service consisting of transportation of packages, collection of a payment instrument issued by or on behalf of the recipient and delivery of a payment instrument to the shipper. The shipper is responsible for specifying on the C.O.D. airbill, or in the appropriate field of the FedEx electronic shipping system or third-party electronic shipping system, the amount (the C.O.D. amount) and the form of payment to be collected. We do not offer a cash-on-delivery service.</p>
<p>B.    If the shipper marks SECURED PAYMENT on the C.O.D. airbill, we will collect a cashier's check, official check or money order. If the shipper marks UNSECURED PAYMENT, we will collect a personal check, certified check, cashier's check, official check, money order or company check. CASH, TRAVELER'S CHECKS, &quot;COM&quot; CHECKS, CREDIT CARDS AND COUNTER CHECKS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED IN PAYMENT OF ANY C.O.D. AMOUNT. If no payment type is selected, an unsecured payment type will be collected at the time of delivery.</p>
<p>C.   Performance of the C.O.D. service does not make us the agent of the shipper for any purpose whatsoever, including, but not limited to, completion of the sale of the goods by the shipper to the recipient. If the recipient cannot be located or fails or refuses to pay the C.O.D. amount via the requested instrument, the shipment will be returned to the shipper, and no refund or credit of either the transportation charges or the C.O.D. charge will be given.</p>
<p>D.   Checks (including cashier's, official, certified, business and personal checks) and money orders for the C.O.D. amount will be collected at the shipper's sole risk, including, but not limited to, all risk of nonpayment, fraud and forgery. FedEx has no liability with respect to any such instrument.</p>
<p>E.    The maximum C.O.D. amount is US$50,000 per shipment. THE C.O.D. AMOUNT IS NOT THE SAME AS, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH, DECLARED VALUE. (See the Declared Value and Limits of Liability section.)</p>
<p>F.    The original transportation of packages, collection of the payment instrument and delivery of the payment instrument are considered a single shipment. The terms and conditions in the Declared Value and Limits of Liability section are applicable to all C.O.D. shipments. If no value is declared, our maximum liability will be the lesser of the C.O.D. amount or US$100. With respect to the C.O.D. shipment sent by a FedEx Express Freight service, if no value is declared, our maximum liability is the greater of US$100 or US$1 per pound.</p>
<p>G.   Our liability for loss, damage, delay, misdelivery, misinformation, nondelivery, failure to collect the C.O.D. amount, failure to collect the specified form of payment, collection of an instrument in the wrong amount, or failure or delay in delivering the payment instrument is limited to the declared value, subject in every event to the maximum declared-value limits and other limitations referenced above and in the Declared Value and Limits of Liability section.</p>
<p>H.   If the shipper sends more than one package on a single C.O.D. airbill, the total declared value for all of the packages must be written in the appropriate airbill section. Our maximum liability will be limited to the total value declared subject in every event to the maximum declared-value limits and other limitations referenced above and in the Declared Value and Limits of Liability section.</p>
<p>I.      The payment instrument will be forwarded to the shipper via FedEx Standard Overnight where available, and otherwise via FedEx 2Day, and will be directed to the shipper's address for the account number on which the C.O.D. shipment was shipped. Return C.O.D. service from Hawaii may be delayed one day due to transit time.</p>
<p>J.     Our money-back guarantee policy applies to transportation charges as well as to the additional charge for C.O.D. service and is the exclusive remedy for refund or credit of these charges in the event of a service failure. See the Money-Back Guarantee Policy section for complete conditions and limitations. When the money-back guarantee is suspended or revoked, there is no remedy.</p>
<p>K.    If 20 percent or more of a sender's C.O.D. shipments are refused, or a sender requests changes to the C.O.D. amount for 10 percent or more of its C.O.D. shipments, FedEx has the option to revoke any discounts applicable to the sender's account without notice (including discounts for non-C.O.D. shipments) and to impose a special handling fee of US$30 per shipment.</p>
<p>L.    C.O.D. transportation charges must be charged to the sender's FedEx account number.</p>
<p>M.   C.O.D. is not available for shipments rated with FedEx One Rate pricing.</p>

<p>B.    As a condition of extending credit privileges, FedEx reserves the right to require business customers to provide current financial information, agree to bank draft arrangements for payment on account, provide a security deposit or provide a bank letter of credit.</p>
<p>C.   When credit privileges are extended, FedEx reserves the right to establish and enforce a credit limit on your account. At our sole discretion, we may review and amend a credit limit on your account.</p>
<p>D.   The invoice date begins the credit term cycle, and payment is due within 15 days from the invoice date. Failure to keep your FedEx account current will result in your account being placed on cash-only status. This status may impair your ability to use our services, delay your shipments, and may result in the loss of any applicable discounts.</p>
<p>E.    IF THE ACCOUNT NUMBER TO BE BILLED IS NOT IN GOOD CREDIT STANDING, THE PACKAGE MAY BE HELD OR STOPPED IN TRANSIT UNTIL YOU MAKE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS. THE MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE POLICY WILL NOT APPLY IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES.</p>
<p>F.    The shipper, and any other party who is liable for payment, is responsible for all reasonable costs incurred by FedEx in obtaining or attempting to obtain payment for services rendered by us. Such costs include, but are not limited to, attorneys' fees, collection agency fees, interest and court costs.</p>
<p>G.   Credit privileges will not be restored until you have paid all past-due balances in full and all costs, fees and expenses incurred by FedEx in collecting or attempting to collect such balances. FedEx may require you to secure the account with a form of payment as a prerequisite to credit restoration. FedEx may decline to restore credit privileges even if all costs, fees and expenses are paid.</p>
<p>H.   Customers requesting removal from cash-only status must contact the Recovery Collections department at <a href="tel:18005067580">1.800.506.7580</a>.</p>
<p>I.      At our sole discretion, we may apply payments made on your account to any unpaid invoice issued on your account.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    All packages containing dangerous goods must comply with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulations and, where applicable, Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Shippers of dangerous goods, whether prepared under ICAO/IATA or 49CFR, must comply with all FedEx Express variations listed in the current edition of the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations. The shipper is responsible for complying with all packing requirements and appropriate marking and labeling of the package, documentation, as well as compliance with applicable local, state, and federal laws, regulations, ordinances and rules. The shipper is also responsible for ensuring the recipient complies with all applicable local, state and federal laws, regulations, ordinances and rules for applicable hazard classes.</p>
<p>B.    Shippers must comply with all applicable local, state and federal laws governing packing, marking and labeling of shipments of blood and blood products, regardless of whether they are infectious.</p>
<p>C.   FedEx packaging may not be used to ship dangerous goods (including dry ice), with the following exceptions:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     Permitted IATA Section II lithium batteries, which may be shipped in FedEx boxes and tubes; and</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     Biological Substance, Category B (UN 3373) shipments, which may be shipped in the FedEx UN 3373 Pak, the FedEx Medium Clinical Box, the FedEx Large Clinical Box or the following FedEx Temp-Assure cold shipping boxes: Small Cold Box Standard Duration; Medium Cold Box Standard Duration; Medium Cold Box Extended Duration; Large Cold Box Standard Duration; and Large Cold Box Extended Duration.</p>
<p>Blood, urine and other specimens containing infectious substances are considered dangerous goods and must not be shipped in the FedEx Clinical Pak. The shipper assumes sole responsibility for compliance with all applicable governmental regulations. For more information on FedEx guidelines, go to fedex.com/packaging and read our brochures on packaging clinical samples and Biological Substance, UN 3373 specimens.</p>
<p>D.   Shipments containing dangerous goods are not eligible for FedEx Express return options, except dry ice, which may be shipped using the FedEx Print Return Label and the FedEx Email Return Label. FedEx Express dangerous goods surcharges are not assessed on certain types of dangerous goods, and these may be shipped via FedEx Stamps. See the Dangerous Goods section at fedex.com for a list of dangerous goods that are not assessed a surcharge.</p>
<p>E.    FedEx Express does not accept dangerous goods shipments prepared exclusively for ground shipment.</p>
<p>F.    FedEx is not required to add dry ice to packages in its system, nor to provide re-icing services.</p>
<p>G.   Common Fireworks (Division 1.4 explosives) will be accepted only with prior approval from FedEx.</p>
<p>H.   Lithium batteries (UN 3090) that are Primary Non-Rechargeable require pre-approval to ship. This applies to IATA Section IA and Section IB lithium batteries. For details, go to fedex.com and enter keyword &quot;lithium batteries.&quot; FedEx Express does not accept UN 3090 and UN 3480 lithium batteries tendered as IATA Section II shipments; they must be tendered as fully regulated IATA Section IA or IB. In addition, FedEx Express does not accept waste batteries or batteries being shipped for recycling or disposal, including damaged or defective batteries (see IATA variation FX–04).</p>
<p>I.      FedEx may require shippers to hire a trained pack-and-ship vendor to resolve a problem with an undeliverable dangerous goods shipment. If the recipient refuses a package containing dangerous goods, or the package leaks or is damaged, it will be returned to the shipper, if possible. If the shipper refuses to accept the returned shipment, or it cannot be returned because of leakage or damage due to faulty packaging, the shipper is responsible for and agrees to reimburse and otherwise indemnify FedEx for all costs, fees and expenses it incurs in connection with the cleanup and disposal of the package. The shipper agrees to indemnify FedEx for any and all costs, fees and expenses FedEx incurs as a result of the shipper's failure to comply with FedEx Dangerous Goods shipping requirements.</p>
<p>J.     We have the right to refuse any package with an odor or any package that is wet or leaking. If a dangerous goods shipment damages or contaminates any property, the shipper is solely responsible for and will reimburse and indemnify FedEx for any and all costs, fees, and expenses it incurs in connection with the cleanup of such damage or contamination.</p>
<p>K.    Not all FedEx locations accept dangerous goods, and we reserve the right to refuse dangerous goods at any location where they cannot be accepted in accordance with applicable law. Dangerous goods shipments, including dry ice, are not allowed at FedEx Drop Box locations, FedEx Office Print and Ship Center locations, FedEx Authorized ShipCenter locations, FedEx OnSite locations, or FedEx ShipSite locations, except as noted below:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.    Biological Substance, Category B (UN 3373) shipments are allowed at select FedEx Office Print and Ship Center locations (contact your local FedEx Office Print and Ship Center for service availability) and may be placed in FedEx Drop Boxes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.    FedEx Express shipments containing permitted IATA Section II lithium batteries are allowed at FedEx Office Print and Ship Center locations and may be placed in FedEx Drop Boxes.</p>
<p>L.    The shipper must provide all required information and complete all boxes pertaining to dangerous goods on the FedEx airbill. Shippers utilizing electronic systems to ship dangerous goods must select, as appropriate to the electronic system, the special services, handling or flag to indicate that their shipment contains dangerous goods.</p>
<p>M.   <i>Note:</i> We are required by law to report improperly declared or undeclared shipments of dangerous goods to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The shipper may be subject to fines and penalties under applicable law. The DOT/Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires every shipper to have job-specific dangerous goods training prior to tendering a dangerous goods shipment to FedEx or another air carrier. When individuals tender a shipment containing dangerous goods it must be properly classified, packaged, marked, labeled and identified as dangerous goods, and include the correct dangerous goods documentation.</p>
<p>N.   Dangerous goods may not be rerouted to an address other than the original intended-recipient's address provided by the shipper. (<i>Note</i>: Shipments may be made available as hold for pickup at permissible locations or be returned to the sender.)</p>
<p>O.   We are required to maintain proper segregation of incompatible dangerous goods on all vehicles and aircraft. This necessity may cause the shipment to move on the next available truck route or flight on which proper segregation can be maintained.</p>
<p>P.    Accessible dangerous goods can be shipped via FedEx First Overnight Freight and FedEx 1Day Freight to and from primary service areas only. Inaccessible dangerous goods can be shipped via FedEx First Overnight Freight, FedEx 1Day Freight, FedEx 2Day Freight and FedEx 3Day Freight to and from primary and extended service areas. Class 7 Radioactive materials cannot be shipped using FedEx First Overnight Freight.</p>
<p>Q.   For more information, see Shipping Dangerous Goods via FedEx Express at fedex.com/dangerousgoods. If you have questions regarding shipments of dangerous goods, you may call 1.800.GoFedEx 1.800.463.3339 and say &quot;dangerous goods&quot; to connect to our Dangerous Goods/Hazardous Materials Hotline for assistance (outside the U.S. call <a href="tel:19013756806">1.901.375.6806</a>).</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    The declared value of any package represents our maximum liability in connection with a shipment of that package, including, but not limited to, any loss, damage, delay, misdelivery, nondelivery, misinformation, any failure to provide information, or misdelivery of information relating to the shipment. It is the shipper's responsibility to prove actual damages. Exposure to and risk of any loss in excess of the declared value is assumed by the shipper. You may transfer this risk to an insurance carrier of your choice through the purchase of an insurance policy. Contact an insurance agent or broker if you desire insurance coverage. WE DO NOT PROVIDE INSURANCE COVERAGE OF ANY KIND.</p>
<p>B.    With respect to U.S. express package services, unless a higher value is declared and paid for, our liability for each package is limited to US$100. For each package exceeding US$100 in declared value, an additional amount will be charged for each US$100 in value or fraction thereof. See Rates in the FedEx Service Guide for details.</p>
<p>C.   With respect to FedEx Express Freight services, unless a higher value is declared and paid for, our liability for each freight handling unit is limited to US$100 or US$1 per pound, whichever is greater. When the declared value exceeds the greater of US$100 or US$1 per pound per shipment, an additional amount will be charged for each US$100 (or fraction thereof) of additional declared value. See Rates in the FedEx Service Guide for details.</p>
<p>D.   Except as limited below, the maximum declared value per package in any FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight, FedEx Standard Overnight, FedEx 2Day A.M., FedEx 2Day or FedEx Express Saver shipment is US$50,000. The maximum declared value per shipment for FedEx SameDay is US$2,000.</p>
<p>E.    Except as limited below, the maximum declared value per each freight handling unit in any FedEx First Overnight Freight, FedEx 1Day Freight, FedEx 2Day Freight or FedEx 3Day Freight shipment is US$50,000.</p>
<p>F.    Shipments (packages or freight) containing all or part of the following items are limited to a maximum declared value of US$1,000:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     Artwork, including any work created or developed by the application of skill, taste or creative talent for sale, display or collection. This includes, but is not limited to, items (and their parts) such as paintings, drawings, vases, tapestries, limited-edition prints, fine art, statuary, sculpture and collector's items.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     Film, photographic images (including photographic negatives), photographic chromes and photographic slides.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     Any commodity that by its inherent nature is particularly susceptible to damage or the market value of which is particularly variable or difficult to ascertain.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     Antiques, or any commodity that exhibits the style or fashion of a past era and whose history, age or rarity contributes to its value. These items include, but are not limited to, furniture, tableware and glassware.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.     Glassware, including, but not limited to, signs, mirrors, ceramics, porcelains, china, crystal, glass, framed glass, and any other commodity with similarly fragile qualities.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.     Plasma screens.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">7.     Jewelry, including, but not limited to, costume jewelry, watches and their parts, mount gems or stones (precious or semiprecious), industrial diamonds, and jewelry made of precious metal.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">8.     Furs, including, but not limited to, fur clothing, fur-trimmed clothing and fur pelts.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">9.     Precious metals, including, but not limited to, gold and silver bullion or dust, precipitates, or platinum (except as an integral part of electronic machinery).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">10.  Stocks, bonds, cash letters or cash equivalents, including, but not limited to, food stamps, postage stamps (not collectible), traveler's checks, lottery tickets, money orders, gift cards and gift certificates, prepaid calling cards (excluding those that require a code for activation), bond coupons, and bearer bonds.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">11.  Collector's items such as coins, stamps, sports cards, souvenirs and memorabilia.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">12.  Guitars and other musical instruments that are more than 20 years old, and customized or personalized musical instruments.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">13.  Scale models (including, but not limited to, architectural models and dollhouses) and prototypes.</p>
<p>G.   The maximum declared value for the contents of any FedEx Envelope or FedEx Pak is US$500. Goods with a value (actual or declared) exceeding US$500 should not be shipped in a FedEx Envelope or FedEx Pak. (This limitation does not apply to items shipped in the FedEx Clinical Pak or FedEx UN 3373 Pak.)</p>
<p>H.   When the shipper sends more than one package on an airbill, the total declared value for all the packages moving on the airbill must be written in the appropriate section of the airbill. Our liability will be limited to the total declared value (not to exceed the per-package limit of US$500 or US$50,000 or the per-shipment limit of US$2,000, as described in this section). The declared value for each package will be determined by dividing the total declared value by the number of packages on the airbill unless you provide verifiable evidence supporting a different allocation.</p>
<p>I.      If a multiple-piece shipment is tendered to FedEx skidded, stackable, forkliftable, banded and/or shrinkwrapped as a single freight handling unit, the maximum declared value for that single freight handling unit is US$50,000 and not US$50,000 per package contained within that multiple-piece shipment.</p>
<p>J.     The maximum declared value we offer for shipments tendered to FedEx using FedEx Stamps purchased from anyone other than FedEx is US$100.</p>
<p>K.    The maximum declared value for FedEx Print Return Label and FedEx Email Return Label shipments is US$1,000 for FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight, FedEx Standard Overnight, FedEx 2Day A.M. and FedEx 2Day, and US$50,000 for FedEx 2Day Freight and FedEx 3Day Freight. The maximum declared value for FedEx ExpressTag shipments is US$50,000. We are not liable for any damage to a shipment or any claim arising out of the use of a return option unless the shipment was lost during delivery or there was visible damage noted by the FedEx courier at the time of delivery. We are not liable for any concealed damage to items returned using FedEx Print Return Label, FedEx Email Return Label, FedEx ExpressTag or FedEx Stamps. Receipt of the shipment by the recipient without notice of damage on delivery is prima facie evidence that the shipment was delivered in good condition. Our liability for any loss or damage will not exceed the actual amount of the damage or the declared-value amount, whichever is lower. All other terms and conditions related to FedEx Express claims regulations apply for shipments sent via a FedEx return option.</p>
<p>L.    ANY EFFORT TO DECLARE A VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE MAXIMUMS ALLOWED IN THE FEDEX SERVICE GUIDE IS NULL AND VOID. OUR ACCEPTANCE FOR CARRIAGE OF ANY SHIPMENT BEARING A DECLARED VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE ALLOWED MAXIMUMS DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF ANY PROVISION OF THE FEDEX SERVICE GUIDE AS TO SUCH SHIPMENT.</p>
<p>M.   REGARDLESS OF THE DECLARED VALUE OF A PACKAGE, OUR LIABILITY FOR LOSS, DAMAGE, DELAY, MISDELIVERY, NONDELIVERY, MISINFORMATION, ANY FAILURE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION, OR MISDELIVERY OF INFORMATION, WILL NOT EXCEED A SHIPMENT'S REPAIR COST, ITS DEPRECIATED VALUE OR ITS REPLACEMENT COST, WHICHEVER IS LESS.</p>
<p>N.   The shipper is responsible for accurately completing the airbill or other shipping documents, including completion of the declared-value section. We cannot honor requests to change the declared-value information on the airbill.</p>
<p>O.   See the Liabilities Not Assumed section for other limitations and exclusions on our liability.</p>
<p>P.    Additional restrictions may apply to a shipment if sent pursuant to an airline interline agreement.</p>
<p>Q.   In the event that FedEx Office procures, accepts tender of, performs, or otherwise undertakes the transportation, delivery or release of a package by FedEx Express, whether directly or indirectly, FedEx Office shall have the benefit of every right, defense, limitation and liberty of whatsoever nature contained in these terms and conditions or otherwise available to FedEx Express as if such provision were expressly for its benefit.</p>

<p>A.    <b>Indirect Signature Required.</b> FedEx will obtain a signature in one of three ways:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     From someone at the delivery address; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     From a neighbor, building manager or other person at a neighboring address; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     The recipient can sign a FedEx door tag or utilize FedEx Delivery Manager to authorize release of the package without anyone present.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">If delivery cannot be completed in these ways, FedEx may reattempt delivery.</p>
<p>B.    <b>Direct Signature Required.</b> FedEx will obtain a signature from someone at the delivery address. If no one is at the address, FedEx may reattempt delivery.</p>
<p>C.   <b>Adult Signature Required.</b> FedEx will obtain a signature from someone at least 21 years old (government-issued photo identification required) at the delivery address. If there is no eligible recipient at the delivery address, FedEx may reattempt delivery.</p>
<p>D.   Shipments to residential addresses may be released without obtaining a signature. If you require a signature for a residential shipment, select one of the Delivery Signature Options.</p>
<p>E.    Indirect Signature Required is not available for shipments to nonresidential addresses.</p>
<p>F.    Choosing a delivery signature option overrides a signature release. (See the Signature Release section.)</p>
<p>G.   FedEx will assess the delivery signature charge if the shipper requests the Delivery Signature Option, even if a signature is not obtained, the option requested is not available or FedEx is unable to provide a copy of the signature obtained at delivery.</p>
<p>H.   Also see the Liabilities Not Assumed, Pickup and Delivery, and Routing and Rerouting sections.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>Transportation charges may be assessed based on dimensional weight, which is a volumetric standard. Dimensional-weight pricing is applicable on a per-package or per-shipment basis to all shipments in customer packaging. FedEx packaging may also be subject to dimensional-weight pricing. If the dimensional weight exceeds the actual weight, charges based on the dimensional weight will be assessed. Customers who fail to apply the dimensional-weight calculation to a package may be assessed dimensional-weight charges from FedEx. See the Dimensional Weight description in the Fees and Other Shipping Information section of the FedEx Service Guide for additional details.</p>

<br />
Any right that you might have to damages, refunds, credits, recovery of reliance interests, disgorgement, restitution, injunctive relief, declaratory relief or any other legal or equitable relief whatsoever against us under any cause of action arising from the transportation of any package pursuant to the FedEx Service Guide shall be extinguished unless you first comply with all applicable notice periods and requirements in these terms and conditions including, but not limited to, the periods and requirements for providing notice under the Billing, Claims and Money-Back Guarantee Policy sections. You and we understand that timely and complete compliance with such notice periods and requirements is a contractual condition precedent to your right to any relief whatsoever, and you must plead compliance with those conditions precedent on the face of any complaint that you file against us. You and we agree that FedEx cannot be considered to have breached any obligation to you unless or until we wrongfully deny a claim submitted to us pursuant to the notice periods and requirements contained in these terms and conditions. Finally, you and we agree that you will comply with applicable notice periods and requirements even if you believe that such compliance will not result in relief from us or if you lack knowledge regarding whether such compliance will result in relief from us.<br />
<br />
You agree that you will not sue us as a class plaintiff or class representative, join as a class member, or participate as an adverse party in any way in a class-action lawsuit against us. Nothing in this paragraph, however, limits your rights to bring a lawsuit as an individual plaintiff.<br />
<br />
To the extent that any court finds that state rather than federal law applies to any provision of this contract, the controlling law is the substantive law of the state in which you tendered your shipment to us.<br />

The performance of any services does not make us an agent of the shipper or any third party for any purpose.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>We offer a money-back guarantee for our services. This guarantee can be suspended, modified or revoked at our sole discretion without prior notice to you.</p>
<p>A.    <b>Money-Back Guarantee.</b> At our option, we will, upon request, either refund or credit your transportation charges in the event of a service failure (which means delivery of your package 60 seconds or more after the published delivery commitment time for the selected service and destination, except as otherwise described in these terms and conditions). This money-back guarantee is your exclusive remedy in the event of a service failure for the recovery of all or any portion of the FedEx charges for a shipment. If the money-back guarantee is suspended, there is no remedy or recovery of charges for a service failure. There are no delivery commitments for shipments on which the money-back guarantee is suspended.</p>
<p>B.    <b>Limitations.</b> The following limitations apply:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     Credits for transportation charges will be applied to the payer's account only, and refunds will be made payable to the payer only.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     Only one refund or credit is permitted per package. In the case of multiple-piece shipments, the money-back guarantee applies to each package in the shipment. If a service failure occurs for any package within the shipment, a refund or credit will be given only for the portion of the transportation charges applicable to that package.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     The money-back guarantee for package services destined for areas outside our primary service areas applies only to the portion of the transportation provided directly by us. The money-back guarantee for FedEx Express Freight services destined for areas outside our primary service areas applies to the portion of the transportation provided directly by us and may also apply to the portion of the transportation provided by the cartage agent (see the Cartage Agent section for details).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     Shipments scheduled for delivery on a holiday will be delivered the next business day. Observance of local holidays (e.g., Mardi Gras, St. Patrick's Day) may cause delivery delays. In both circumstances, the delivery commitment for application of the money-back guarantee policy will be extended for a period equal to the length of the holiday.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.     If a delivery later than the original delivery commitment time is requested by the shipper or recipient before the first delivery attempt is made, the delivery commitment time for application of the money-back guarantee policy will be adjusted to account for the requested delivery date and/or time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.     If the shipper or recipient informed FedEx that the recipient location is closed on a certain day or at a certain time, the delivery commitment time for application of the money-back guarantee policy will be the next business day at the delivery commitment time for the service originally selected.</p>
<p>C.   <b>Exceptions.</b> FedEx will not be obligated to refund or credit your transportation charges if:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     We provide you with proof of timely delivery, consisting of the date and time of delivery and, if applicable, the name of the person who signed for the shipment, or service-exception information reflecting that the failure to deliver timely resulted from circumstances described under the Liabilities Not Assumed section.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     The service failure resulted, in whole or in part, from any of the circumstances described under the Liabilities Not Assumed section.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     The payer's FedEx account number was not in good credit standing, or payment instructions were invalid, and delivery was delayed until payment arrangements were secured.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     The shipment was scheduled for delivery on the Wednesday immediately prior to Thanksgiving via any FedEx Express U.S. or FedEx Express Freight U.S. service, and was delivered within 90 minutes of the published delivery commitment time for the selected service and destination.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.     The shipment was scheduled for delivery during the seven calendar days before Christmas Day via any FedEx Express U.S. or FedEx Express Freight U.S. service, and was delivered by the end of the day on the published delivery commitment date for the selected service and destination.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.     The shipment was rerouted from the delivery address to a Hold at Location address.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">7.     The shipment was undeliverable or returned.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">8.     The shipment contained dangerous goods or dry ice.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">9.     The shipment was delayed due to an incorrect address or ZIP code or the unavailability or refusal of an appropriate or eligible person to accept delivery or sign for the package.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">10.  The shipment was delayed due to security or other regulatory delays, including permanent, regular, or daily security procedures at the recipient location.</p>
<p>D.   <b>Refund or Credit Requests.</b> To qualify for a refund or credit due to a service failure, you must notify us of the service failure and request a refund or credit of your transportation charges in compliance with the conditions listed below. If you do not comply with these conditions, you are not entitled to receive a refund or credit and cannot recover compensation for a service failure in any lawsuit.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     You may request a refund or credit of transportation charges due to a service failure in the following ways:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">a.     Use our internet application FedEx Billing Online at fedex.com if you are a registered user; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">b.     Submit your request through the invoice adjustment feature at fedex.com; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">c.     Submit the request via our telephone invoice adjustment system at<b> </b><a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a> (say &quot;billing&quot;).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">d.     For FedEx SameDay or FedEx SameDay Freight requests, submit your request via our telephone billing option at <a href="tel:18003995999">1.800.399.5999</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;"><i>Note:</i> Requests for a refund of FedEx Delivery Manager delivery-option fees must be made by the recipient online at fedex.com/billingadjustment. See FedEx Delivery Manager Terms in the fedex.com Terms of Use.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     Your notification of a service failure must include your FedEx account number, if any; the FedEx tracking number; and the date of the shipment.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     All requests for refund or credit of transportation charges must be received via one of the approved channels within 15 calendar days of the invoice date or within 15 calendar days from the ship date if you are paying by credit card or in advance by cash, check or money order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     A partial payment against an invoice is not considered a request for invoice adjustment or notice of a refund request. A notification of the reason for an unpaid charge with your payment is not considered a request for an invoice adjustment or notice of a refund request if the reason relates to a service failure.</p>

<p>B.  Package Consolidators may submit claims for refunds or credits for shipping charges under the money-back guarantee policy.

<p>C.<b>  </b>In order for a Package Consolidator to receive packaging supplies from FedEx, the Package Consolidator must first enter into a Packaging and Pricing Agreement or a FedEx Authorized ShipCenter Agreement with FedEx.</p>
<p>D.  Package Consolidators may charge FedEx Retail Rates for FedEx shipping services, but they are not required to. Package Consolidators set their own rates for reselling FedEx services.</p>
<p>E.  FedEx assumes no liability, other than to the Package Consolidator, for lost, damaged or delayed shipments tendered to a Package Consolidator, as the Package Consolidator is the shipper of these packages. Package Consolidators are independently owned and operated businesses.</p>
<p>F.<b>  </b>See the Package Consolidator representative for information regarding rates and services and the terms and conditions of carriage. Inquiries or claims regarding shipments tendered to a Package Consolidator must also be directed to the Package Consolidator.<b></b></p>
<p>G.  As directed by FedEx, Package Consolidators must require a government-issued photo ID to validate the identity of their customer and must keep a record of the name and address on the ID of their customer for each package. <br />

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>The maximum limits for FedEx Express U.S. packages are 150 lbs. and 119 inches in length and 165 inches in length and girth. Packages that weigh 150 lbs. or less and exceed 96 inches in length or 130 inches in length and girth will be considered &quot;oversize&quot; packages. Oversize packages will be rated based on the greater of the package's actual rounded weight or dimensional weight, subject to a 90-lb. minimum billable weight. In addition, an oversize charge will apply; see Rates in the FedEx Service Guide.<br />
<br />
Packages that exceed 119 inches in length and 165 inches in length and girth may be refused or, if found in the express package network, may be considered for transportation at our sole discretion. These packages also will be rated based on the greater of the package's actual rounded weight or dimensional weight, subject to a 90-lb. minimum billable weight, and an oversize charge will apply.<br />
<br />
The length and girth of a package is length plus (two times the height) plus (two times the width). If the dimension includes a fraction, a fraction of one-half or greater will be rounded up to the next whole number; less than one-half will be rounded down to the next whole number.<br />

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    You must comply with all applicable local, state and federal laws, including those governing packing, marking and labeling for all shipments.</p>
<p>B.    All packages must be prepared and packed by the shipper for safe transportation with ordinary care in handling in an express-transportation environment. Any articles susceptible to damage as a result of conditions that may be encountered in transportation, such as changes in temperature or atmospheric pressure, must be adequately protected by proper packaging. Each shipment must be legibly and durably marked with the name, address and ZIP code of both the shipper and the recipient. Packages cannot be wrapped in kraft paper.</p>
<p>C.   You must use FedEx packaging or new corrugated boxes in good, rigid condition large enough to allow cushioning of contents on the top, bottom and sides. For guidelines on packaging specific commodities go to fedex.com/packaging. Items that cannot be packed into cartons (such as auto tail pipes, mufflers, tires and rims) must have all sharp edges and protrusions wrapped, and the address label must be secured using the tie-on tag or the tire/crate label provided by FedEx (or you may secure it by wrapping pressure-sensitive tape completely around the object). Briefcases, luggage, garment bags, aluminum cases, plastic cases, computer cartons or similar types of items whose outer finish might be damaged by adhesive labels, soiling, marking or other types of surface damage that is normal with ordinary care in handling should be placed in a protective container for shipment. Casters, wheels and rollers must be removed or packaged.</p>
<p>D.   FedEx Express Saver shipments cannot use the FedEx Small Box, FedEx Medium Box, FedEx Large Box, FedEx Extra Large Box or FedEx Tube, unless rated with FedEx One Rate pricing.</p>
<p>E.    Expanded polystyrene foam coolers must be shipped inside a sturdy outer container unless tested and approved for acceptance by FedEx Packaging Design and Development. Information on how to submit your packaging for testing is available at fedex.com/packaging. Expanded polystyrene foam coolers containing blood, urine and other non-infectious liquid clinical specimens must be shipped inside a sturdy outer packaging.</p>
<p>F.    If a shipment is refused by the recipient, leaks or is damaged, the shipment will be returned to the sender if possible. If the sender refuses to accept the returned shipment or it cannot be returned because of leakage, or damage due to faulty packaging, the shipper is responsible for and will reimburse FedEx for all costs and fees of any type connected with the legal disposal of the shipment, and all costs and fees of any type connected with cleanup of any spill or leakage.</p>
<p>G.   FedEx does not recommend the use of wet ice (frozen water) as a refrigerant. Packages containing wet ice must be prepared to prevent the leakage of any liquid, regardless of package orientation. For additional wet-ice packaging requirements, refer to the packaging guide Packaging Perishable Shipments at fedex.com/packaging.</p>
<p>H.   FedEx reserves the right to request a shipper to submit a representative sampling of the packaging for inspection and testing. If the shipper fails to comply with our request to inspect and test the packaging, or the sampling fails FedEx testing, FedEx will not be liable for any damages due to improper packaging.</p>
<p>I.      FedEx may issue written notice to you if you repeatedly fail to adhere to FedEx's packaging requirements due to your pattern or practice of insufficient packaging. Claims for damage or loss associated with an identified pattern or practice of insufficient packaging will be denied. Any such claim filed related to your shipments will not be paid, regardless of which party files the claim, unless the claimant can establish that the loss or damage did not result from a failure to use proper packaging. FedEx will continue to deny such claims until we determine that you have ceased the pattern or practice of failing to adhere to the packaging requirements. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to limit FedEx's right to deny a claim where the shipment in dispute is found to have improper packaging.</p>
<p>J.     Information on how to submit your packaging for testing or evaluation, and tips on packaging specific commodities (including automotive and mechanical parts, computers and perishables), are available at fedex.com/packaging.</p>
<p>K.    For FedEx Express Freight shipments, freight must be on a skid, pallet or other forkliftable base. Boxes should be stacked squarely on the skid without hanging over the edge, and the weight should be distributed evenly on the skid to avoid excess weight being placed on materials inside the cartons. Use 70-gauge stretch wrap and pass a minimum of two bands (tightly secured) through the skid voids and around all cartons.</p>
<p>L.    FedEx account holders may order supplies via fedex.com or by calling<b> </b><a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a> (say &quot;order shipping supplies&quot;).</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>Shipments containing perishable articles must be packaged for a minimum transit time of at least 12 hours greater than our delivery commitment time for the shipment. Perishables coming from Hawaii to the continental U.S. must be packaged for additional transit time. Shipping perishable articles over a weekend or holiday is discouraged, and packaging such shipments for longer transit times is required. We recommend that you ship perishable items via FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight, FedEx First Overnight Freight or FedEx 1Day Freight, and have your proposed packaging evaluated by FedEx Packaging Design and Development. Information on how to submit your packaging for evaluation is available at fedex.com/packaging.

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    We do not offer a restricted-delivery service and may deliver to someone other than the person or entity named as the recipient. We also may make an indirect delivery. Indirect delivery is a completed delivery to an address or location other than the address on the airbill and includes shipments delivered via Indirect Signature Required service. Packages cannot be delivered to P.O. boxes or P.O. box ZIP codes. Package addresses must include the complete street address and ZIP code of the recipient.</p>
<p>B.    If our first delivery attempt of a shipment to a non-residential address is unsuccessful, we may make two additional attempts on the following two consecutive business days. If a package still cannot be delivered, we may hold it for two additional business days and may research its status with the sender, recipient, or both, and receive further instruction. After that time, we will return it to the sender as undeliverable.</p>
<p>C.   Shipments to hotels, hospitals, government offices or installations, university campuses, or other facilities that utilize a mailroom or other central receiving area will be delivered to the central receiving area, unless otherwise authorized and approved by FedEx.</p>
<p>D.   Any person scheduling a pickup other than the sender must provide a FedEx account number in good credit standing; otherwise, the pickup must be scheduled by the sender. We require a minimum of two hours from the time the shipment(s) will be ready to make the pickup. (Contact FedEx Customer Service for the specific lead times required.) Repeated pickup attempts without packages being ready may result in the cancellation of pickup privileges.</p>
<p>E.    Proof of pickup is available upon request. You must provide the pickup number or FedEx tracking number (also known as the airbill number). We will not provide proof of pickup unless you provide this information.</p>
<p>F.    At our sole discretion, we may refuse to pick up or deliver a shipment (package or freight), or use alternative pickup or delivery arrangements, to maintain the safety of our employees and in cases in which we believe that our services may be used in violation of local, state or federal laws.</p>
<p>G.   Additional charges may apply for late-hours, weekend or holiday pickup and delivery.</p>
<p>H.   Pickup and delivery may not be available in all areas.</p>
<p>I.      A return pickup surcharge applies for FedEx Print Return Label, FedEx Email Return Label and FedEx Express Billable Stamp shipments.</p>
<p>J.     In order to facilitate delivery or release of a shipment, FedEx may, at its sole discretion, contact the recipient to obtain delivery instructions, or to notify them that a delivery is scheduled, that a delivery has been completed or that a shipment is available for pickup at a Hold at Location facility. FedEx may also accept requests for delivery options from a recipient using FedEx Delivery Manager.</p>
<p>K.    At its discretion, FedEx may not deliver or attempt delivery within the delivery commitment time of the service requested, if the shipper or recipient requested a later delivery or informed FedEx that the recipient is closed during the delivery commitment time. In this situation, charges will be assessed based on the service initially selected by the shipper. The shipper or payer is responsible for communicating with the recipient regarding requested later delivery times and is responsible for knowing the days and times that the recipient location can accept FedEx deliveries.</p>
<p>L.    If a shipper tenders packages that substantially exceed the number, type, size and/or weight of packages tendered on average for the location by the shipper throughout the year, FedEx may accept such packages but, at its sole discretion, suspend the FedEx Money-Back Guarantee, if applicable, or adjust commitment times.</p>
<p>M.   We reserve the right to assess a Residential Delivery surcharge on any shipment delivered to a home or private residence, including locations where a business is operated from a home, or on any shipment in which the shipper has designated the delivery address as a residence, including shipments where the delivery location has been designated as Residential Delivery in error.</p>

Any conflict or inconsistency between the FedEx Service Guide and other written or oral statements or quotes (except those found in a FedEx Sales or FedEx Express Customer Automation agreement) concerning the rates, features of service, and terms and conditions applicable to FedEx Express service will be controlled by the FedEx Service Guide, as modified, amended, changed or supplemented. We are not liable for, nor will any adjustment, refund or credit of any kind be made, as a result of any discrepancy in any rate or service quotation made prior to tender of the shipment and the rates, and other charges that we invoice to you. Rates quoted will vary depending on whether (1) the shipper is a FedEx account holder and (2) the shipper has discounts applied to his or her account.</p>

<p>1.    A special handling charge will be billed to the account number specified on the FedEx airbill for each rerouted package, and it will appear as an address correction on the invoice. This charge will not be applied when a package is changed to Hold at Location and the FedEx location is in the same city as the city on the airbill. Otherwise, the special handling charges will apply. See Rates in the FedEx Service Guide for details.</p>
<p>2.    To reroute a shipment, the sender must call<b> </b><a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a> and provide us with a FedEx account number, the FedEx tracking number, the new destination and a valid contact telephone number for the recipient. A reroute to Hold at Location can also be requested through fedex.com.</p>
<p>3.    We may not honor a reroute request from the recipient other than to Hold at Location within the original destination city.</p>
<p>4.    Our money-back guarantee policy does not apply to shipments that are rerouted. We have no liability or any remedy for service failure for these shipments.</p>
<p>5.    Only one reroute will be allowed per package.</p>
<p>6.    We may require photo identification of the person authorized to pick up the package.</p>
<p>7.    FedEx may not reroute shipments when Adult Signature Required has been selected or applied as a delivery signature option.</p>
<p>8.    Dangerous goods may not be rerouted to an address other than the original intended-recipient's address provided by the shipper. (<i>Note</i>: Shipments may be made available as hold for pickup or be returned to the sender.)</p>
<p>9.    Any requested change to an address that is not a reroute or an address correction is a new shipment, and new shipping charges will apply.</p>
<p>We will determine the routing of all shipments, including the mode of transportation used, and may use air transportation, ground transportation or any combination thereof in providing our services. We reserve the right to divert any shipment (including use of other carriers) in order to facilitate its delivery.</p>

<li>The recipient refuses to pay for a bill-recipient shipment.</li>
<li>The recipient of a Hold at Location shipment cannot be located.</li>
<li>The recipient refuses to accept the shipment prior to, during or after delivery.</li>
<li>The recipient's delivery address cannot be located.</li>
<li>The shipment was addressed to an area not served by FedEx.</li>
<li>The shipment's contents or packaging are damaged to the point that rewrapping is not possible.</li>
<li>The shipment would likely cause damage or delay to other shipments or property or injury to personnel.</li>
<li>The shipment contains prohibited items.</li>
<li>The recipient's place of business is closed.</li>
<li>No appropriate person was available to accept the shipment at a delivery location on the initial delivery attempt or reattempts.</li>
<li>The shipment was improperly packaged.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
When practicable, we will contact the sender for instructions on returning or otherwise disposing of the shipment. If the sender requests return, it will travel by FedEx 2Day, FedEx Express Saver or FedEx Priority Overnight (shipping will be charged to the sender).</p>
<p>A.    If a package shipment is undeliverable for any reason, we will attempt to notify the shipper to arrange for the shipment's return. The charges associated with the original shipment remain due and payable within 15 days from the invoice date. If a package is marked &quot;Bill Recipient&quot; and is refused or returned to the sender, the billing is automatically changed to &quot;Bill Sender.&quot;</p>
<p>B.    Package shipments will be returned via FedEx Express Saver service at the shipper's expense unless contrary instructions are received from the shipper after five business days from the initial delivery attempt. However, nonfreight package shipments will be returned via FedEx Priority Overnight service at no additional charge if the shipment is undeliverable because of a service failure or damage to the shipment caused by FedEx. If the shipment is undeliverable for any other reason, all return charges and fees will be assessed to the original shipper, along with the original transportation charges and fees.</p>
<p>C.    If a FedEx Express Freight shipment is marked &quot;Bill Recipient&quot; and is refused or returned to the sender, the billing is automatically changed to &quot;Bill Sender.&quot;<br />
<br />
All FedEx Express Freight shipments will be returned via FedEx 3Day Freight. The freight shipment will be returned at no additional charge if the freight shipment is undeliverable because of a service failure. If the shipper requests return via another service, our regular rates will apply. If the freight shipment is undeliverable because of a non-service-failure reason, all return charges and fees will be assessed to the original shipper, along with the original transportation charges and fees.<br />
<br />
Our money-back guarantee policy does not apply to undeliverable or returned shipments.</p>
<p>D.    Dangerous goods shipments will only be returned via FedEx Dangerous Goods Service or other appropriate means. A dangerous goods special handling fee applies. The shipper must supply a completed return airbill and all other required documentation.</p>
<p>E.    FedEx reserves the right, at its sole discretion, and without notice, to sell, destroy or otherwise dispose of undeliverable shipments. By tendering a shipment, the shipper agrees to transfer and convey good and sufficient title of the contents of undeliverable shipments to FedEx, and agrees to pay any costs incurred in the sale, destruction or disposal thereof.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>These FedEx Express Terms and Conditions, contained in the FedEx Service Guide, supersede all previous terms and conditions, amendments, supplements, and other prior statements concerning the rates and conditions of FedEx Express service to which these terms and conditions apply. The contract of carriage as expressed in these terms and conditions constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all previous agreements and understandings, whether oral or written, between the parties or any agents, affiliates or subcontractors thereof (including FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. and its agents, affiliates and employees [&quot;FedEx Office&quot;]) with respect to the subject matter hereof, and each party warrants that it has not relied and will not be relying upon any evaluation, representation or advice from the other party, its agents, affiliates or subcontractors (including any agents, affiliates or employees of FedEx Office) except representations expressly made in writing in these terms and conditions. The downloadable version (PDF) of the FedEx Express Terms and Conditions at fedex.com on the date of shipment is controlling.</p>
<p>The FedEx Service Guide consists of the service information at fedex.com/serviceguide and the overview of services in the downloadable FedEx Service Guide (U.S. and U.S. export); U.S., U.S. export, U.S. import and U.S. retail rates; these FedEx Express Terms and Conditions; the FedEx Ground Tariff; and the FedEx SameDay City Tariff. The service information at fedex.com/serviceguide (excluding rates, the FedEx Express Terms and Conditions, the FedEx Ground Tariff, and the FedEx SameDay City Tariff) and the overview of services in the downloadable FedEx Service Guide are not part of the contract of carriage. FedEx reserves the right to unilaterally modify, amend, change or supplement the FedEx Service Guide, including, but not limited to, the rates, services, features of service, and these terms and conditions, without notice. Only an officer in the Legal Department of FedEx Corporation or successor positions may authorize a supplement to, or modification, change or amendment of, the FedEx Service Guide. No other agent or employee of FedEx, its affiliates or subsidiaries, nor any other person or party, is authorized to do so. This restriction in modification does not apply to a modification applicable to a single customer and included in a FedEx Sales or FedEx Customer Automation agreement. To the extent a conflict exists between a FedEx Sales or FedEx Customer Automation agreement and these FedEx Express Terms and Conditions, the FedEx Sales or FedEx Customer Automation agreement controls.</p>
<p>Any failure to enforce or apply a term, condition, or provision of the FedEx Service Guide shall not constitute a waiver of that term, condition or provision or otherwise impair our right to enforce or apply such a term, condition or provision in the future.</p>
<p><b>International Shipments (U.S. Edition)</b><br />
The following pages contain the FedEx Express Terms and Conditions applicable to FedEx Express international services and service options (including FedEx International Next Flight, FedEx International First, FedEx International Priority, FedEx International Priority Freight, FedEx International Broker Select, FedEx International Priority DirectDistribution, FedEx International Priority DirectDistribution Freight, FedEx International Controlled Export, FedEx 10kg Box, FedEx 25kg Box, FedEx International MailService, FedEx International Economy and FedEx International Economy Freight) from the U.S. to selected international destinations and between Puerto Rico and the U.S., including, but not limited to, any such items tendered by customers utilizing FedEx electronic shipping systems, air waybills, labels and shipping software. For international shipments tendered for FedEx International Premium, FedEx International Express Freight or FedEx International Airport-to-Airport, please see the applicable Service Guide, terms and conditions, and/or tariffs for these services. Refer to fedex.com/us/terms/other-services. (Note: fedex.com URLs are subject to change.) See the U.S. Shipments section when shipping to and from points within the U.S., including Alaska and Hawaii. Shipments originating outside the U.S. for U.S. or other international destinations are subject to local tariffs and the terms and conditions of the FedEx subsidiary, branch or the independent contractor that accepted the shipment. These terms and conditions include terms regarding the importation and customs clearance of shipments into the U.S. See the FedEx Ground Tariff when shipping by FedEx Ground.</p>
<p>If there is a conflict between these terms and conditions and the terms and conditions on any FedEx air waybill, shipping label or other transit documentation, the terms and conditions in the FedEx Service Guide, as amended, modified, changed or supplemented, will control to the extent they are not in conflict with the rules relating to liability for international carriage established by the Warsaw Convention, as amended, or Montreal Convention, other applicable treaties or any applicable tariff.</p>
<p>Rates and service quotations by our employees and agents are based upon information you provide, but final rates and service may vary based upon the shipment actually tendered and the application of these terms and conditions. Rates quoted will vary depending on whether (1) the shipper is a FedEx account holder and (2) the shipper has discounts applied to his or her account.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shippers will be quoted FedEx Standard List Rates if they have a valid FedEx account, do not have discounts applied to their account and if they charge their shipping to their account.</li>
<li>Shippers will be quoted Account-Specific Rates if they have a valid FedEx account, have discounts applied to their account and if they charge their shipping to their account.</li>
<li>Shippers will be quoted FedEx Retail Rates for shipments originating in the U.S. that are paid for by cash, check, debit or credit card instead of being charged to a valid FedEx account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any conflict or inconsistency between the FedEx Service Guide and other written or oral statements concerning the rates, features of service, and terms and conditions applicable to FedEx Express international services from the U.S. to international locations and many terms regarding importation and inbound clearance of shipments into the U.S. will be controlled by the FedEx Service Guide, as modified, amended or supplemented.<br />
<br />

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>All shipments originating in the U.S. and paid for with cash, check, debit or credit card must be tendered at a staffed shipping location, and will be charged FedEx Retail Rates.</p>
<p>For transactions other than &quot;Bill Sender,&quot; &quot;Bill Recipient&quot; or &quot;Bill Third Party,&quot; you must pay by cash (not accepted at all FedEx locations), check, money order or credit card. Payment is required when you give us your package. For &quot;Bill Sender&quot; and &quot;Bill Third Party&quot; transactions, packages will not be accepted unless you provide a valid FedEx account number.</p>
<p>For &quot;Bill Recipient&quot; transactions, packages can be tendered without payment, but in order for the package to be delivered, the recipient must provide a valid FedEx account number or pay with cash, check, money order or credit card (if accepted as a form of payment in the destination country) at time of delivery. If the recipient or third party refuses to pay any transportation charges and other fees, including, but not limited to, duties and taxes, the package will be treated as undeliverable and the sender will be responsible for all transportation charges and other fees, including all special handling fees and duties and taxes.</p>
<p>For customers utilizing our electronic shipping systems, a valid FedEx account number is required for &quot;Bill Sender,&quot; &quot;Bill Recipient&quot; or &quot;Bill Third Party&quot; transactions.</p>
<p>Account numbers are issued by FedEx according to shipping location and are nontransferable. Account numbers are issued and used solely at the discretion of FedEx. FedEx may discontinue the use of accounts, in whole or in part, and terminate all or particular accounts and account numbers at any time, for any reason, at its sole discretion. Improper, illegal or any other misuse of your FedEx account may also, at the sole discretion of FedEx, result in loss of discounts or termination of the account. Improper, illegal or other misuse includes, but is not limited to, ordering supplies for any purpose other than shipping with FedEx, unauthorized consolidation of shipments owned by different parties, or violations of the terms and conditions in this FedEx Service Guide. If your account has been compromised or stolen, the account may be closed and you may be issued a new account. However, you will be responsible for all valid charges on the closed account. Any supplies, materials, rights or privileges that you acquire by holding a FedEx account number may not be used for any purpose other than shipping with FedEx, and FedEx may seek damages against you for any improper, illegal or other misuse of your account. If your account is terminated, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to deny your application for new or additional FedEx account numbers at any time in the future. Except for Canada- and Puerto Rico-based accounts, international account numbers may not be used for shipments between two points within the U.S. All charges will be billed and must be remitted in U.S. funds.<br />
</p>
<p>Any individual or entity that uses the FedEx account or shipping discounts of another FedEx account holder without authorization will be charged Standard List Rates for all such shipments without prior notice. This includes all shipments, whether they are classified as “Bill Sender,” “Bill Recipient” or “Bill Third Party,” or any other method of billing. Unauthorized use includes, but is not limited to, using the shipping discount of another FedEx account holder without the knowledge and permission of both FedEx and the account holder.</p>
<p>All requests for account numbers are subject to credit investigation and verification by our Credit Department and Customer Account Confirmation Department. FedEx utilizes business credit reporting agencies, audited financial statements, Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's bond ratings, and other sources as necessary, to determine eligibility for open credit terms. FedEx does not offer consumer credit privileges. Any individual shipping for personal use must prepay the shipment charges or establish a FedEx account for billing directly to a major credit card. Stored-value cards or gift cards cannot be used to open an account; however, such cards may be used for payment when tendering a package at staffed FedEx shipping locations, and in conjunction with our credit card acceptance policy. If your FedEx account is billed directly to a credit card, you agree to the following terms: (1) you authorize FedEx to initiate variable charges to the credit card to settle charges payable to FedEx; (2) you authorize FedEx to charge your card for any unpaid amounts on your account; (3) you authorize the card issuer to pay any amounts associated with your account without requiring a signed receipt; (4) you agree to keep your card information current (FedEx may receive updates on your card information from participating issuing banks and may update your account profile to avoid service disruptions); (5) you agree that FedEx shall have no liability for any insufficient funds or other charges incurred from attempts to charge and/or place holds on your card; and (6) your agreement to these terms and conditions is to be accepted as authorization to the card issuer to pay all amounts associated with your account.</p>
<p>The party to whom a FedEx account number is issued is liable for all charges to the account, including those resulting from unauthorized use. The account holder is responsible for the safekeeping of the account number. The account number should be released only to those authorized to ship on the account.</p>
<p>Failure to keep your FedEx account current may result in your account being placed on a cash-only status. Use of an account on cash-only status may result in your package being delayed, rejected or returned until arrangements for payment are completed. If the account number to be billed is not valid, the shipment may be refused, delayed or returned until an alternative form of payment is secured. If a package is held, returned, or delivery is otherwise delayed because the account is not in good credit standing, you will not be entitled to a refund or credit of your transportation charges under the Service Failure Money-Back Guarantee Policy.</p>
<p>You must use your FedEx account number to obtain any discount applicable to your account. Use of your account number constitutes your agreement that all packages and freight shipped via FedEx Express international services shall be subject to these terms and conditions, as modified, amended or supplemented.</p>
<p>FedEx may provide trade credit information on its account holders to credit bureaus.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.   &quot;Bill Sender&quot; means the specified charges will be billed to the sender. The sender's FedEx account number must appear in the appropriate section of the air waybill, and the account should be current. FedEx International Next Flight and FedEx International MailService shipments may only be shipped &quot;Bill Sender&quot; and &quot;Bill Third Party,&quot; but all charges must be verified (for U.S. accounts only). For duty-and-tax charges, &quot;Bill Sender&quot; means the sender will be invoiced for applicable duties and taxes and additional ancillary clearance fees incurred.</p>
<p>B.   &quot;Bill Recipient&quot; means the specified charges will be billed to the recipient. In order to choose this billing option, the recipient's valid FedEx account number must appear on the air waybill before it is delivered and payment on the account must be current, or the recipient must pay for the package at time of delivery. If the recipient is billed initially and refuses to make payment for the shipment, the charges may be rebilled to a third party. If not paid by the third party, any additional rebilling must be to the sender's account. The sender is liable for, and will be billed for, all charges and fees in the event the recipient or any third party does not pay.</p>
<p>C.   &quot;Bill Third Party&quot; means the specified charges will be billed to someone other than the sender or recipient. In order to choose this billing option, the third party's valid FedEx account number must be entered in the appropriate section of the air waybill and must be in good credit standing. The sender is liable for, and will be billed for, all charges and fees in the event the recipient or any third party does not pay. If the third party refuses to pay, the transportation charges will automatically be billed to the sender and duties and taxes to the recipient. If the third party does not have credit arrangements with FedEx, the sender will automatically be billed.</p>
<p>D.   Invoices for transportation charges are payable within 15 days of the invoice date. Invoices for duties and taxes are payable upon receipt.</p>
<p>E.   We reserve the right to verify the method of payment for any shipment and to refuse any shipment for which the method of payment cannot be verified.</p>
<p>F.   FedEx may consider payment type in determining pricing and discounts, and reserves the right to adjust discounts based on payment type.</p>
<p>G.   <b>Payer Rebilling.</b> At our sole discretion, we may accept requests to change billing instructions from the shipper or current bill-to party up to 90 days from the current invoice date. FedEx must receive prior approval from the new bill-to party for:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Transportation charges being rebilled to a consignee or third party when not due to a FedEx billing error.</li>
<li>Duty-and-tax charges being rebilled to the shipper if originally billed to the consignee and not due to a FedEx billing error.</li>
<li>Duty-and-tax charges being rebilled to the consignee or third party when not due to a FedEx billing error.</li>
</ul>
<p>Requests for rebilling of transportation charges must be received via one of the approved channels:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">1.    Submit your request through the Non-Pay option with Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) if you are a registered user; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">2.    Use our internet application FedEx Billing Online at fedex.com if you are a registered user; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">3.    Submit your request via fedex.com/us/customersupport/email/express_ground.html (select Billing/Invoicing as the category). Your request for a rebill of transportation charges must include the current invoice number, the FedEx tracking number, amount and the new FedEx account number that you want to rebill; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">4.    Submit the request via our automated interactive voice response system at <b><a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a></b> (say &quot;billing&quot;). Your request for a rebill of transportation charges must include your FedEx account number, if any, the current invoice number, the FedEx tracking number and the new FedEx account number that you want to rebill.</p>
<p>H.   <b>Billing and Special Handling Fees:</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">1.     A special handling fee will be charged where no account number appears on the air waybill or where an incomplete, inaccurate or invalid account number appears on the air waybill in &quot;Bill Sender,&quot; &quot;Bill Recipient&quot; or &quot;Bill Third Party&quot; transactions. If a &quot;Bill Sender,&quot; &quot;Bill Recipient&quot; or &quot;Bill Third Party&quot; package is received without a FedEx account number, we will attempt to determine the correct account from our records and bill the account for all charges and fees, plus the special handling fee. Any applicable discount will apply. If, however, we cannot determine the correct account, the transportation charges plus the special handling fee will be billed directly to the sender and no discount will be allowed. See Rates in the FedEx Service Guide for details.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">2.     A US$20 special handling fee will be charged to you for any check or electronic funds transfer that is dishonored for any reason.</p>
<p>I.   Duties and taxes may be assessed on the contents of shipments destined for international locations. If we advance duties and taxes on behalf of the payer, the payer may be assessed an ancillary clearance service fee based on a flat rate or a percentage of the total amount advanced (whichever is greater). See the Duties and Taxes section for details.</p>
<p>J.   Electronically captured data will be used for billing purposes in the event a billing copy of the air waybill is not available at the time of billing.</p>
<p>K.   Charges in freely convertible currencies other than U.S. dollars are billed to the payer's account. Charges requiring conversion to a currency other than U.S. dollars will be calculated daily using the median bid price obtained from OANDA, an internet exchange-rate service, except for those currencies where the customary practice is to use local bank rates to convert currency for payers in that country. The median bid price is the average price at which buyers offer to buy currencies from sellers during the given period. These currency conversion rates can be accessed at www.oanda.com.<br />
<br />
The currency-conversion rate in effect one day prior to the ship date will be used for conversions to non-hyper-inflationary currencies. However, we reserve the right to use the exchange rate at invoice date, as opposed to shipment date, in countries where the currency is volatile.<br />
<br />
There is an additional exchange fee of 1.75 percent for conversion from any non-U.S. currency to U.S. dollars, 2.3 percent for U.S. dollars to any currency, and 2.0 percent between all non-U.S. currency conversions. The currencies of participating European Union countries will have stationary conversion rates to the euro. There is no exchange fee between currencies related to the euro. Charges in currencies other than the U.S. dollars that are not freely convertible will be converted to U.S. dollars and billed to the payer's account either at the free-market rate or at the official rate at which FedEx was permitted to purchase U.S. dollars in the relevant currency, at our sole option.</p>
<p>L.   NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE GIVEN TO FEDEX, THE SENDER IS ULTIMATELY LIABLE FOR, WILL BE BILLED FOR, AND AGREES TO PAY, ALL CHARGES AND FEES, INCLUDING ANY SPECIAL HANDLING FEES AND ANY DUTIES OR TAXES WHICH WE HAVE ADVANCED, REGARDLESS OF ANY PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CONTRARY, IF THE RECIPIENT OR THIRD PARTY FAILS OR REFUSES TO PAY. For FedEx Global Returns shipments, please see Return and Import Shipping Options.</p>
<p>M.   Your payment must be accompanied by the remittance data that supports the payment. Remittance data must include the FedEx invoice number and the associated amount(s) being paid on the FedEx invoice. Payment at the airbill level or tracking-number level must be transmitted to FedEx via electronic data interchange (EDI) — see the EDI section below.</p>

<p>O.   If you are interested in or have questions regarding any of our invoicing or payment methods, contact your FedEx account executive or call Revenue Services at <b><a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a></b> (say &quot;billing&quot;), or access our internet application Manage My Account at fedex.com.</p>
<p>P.   <b>Invoice Adjustments/Overcharges:</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">1.     We reserve the right to audit shipments to verify service selection, shipment weight and dimensions. Package shape and dimensions may change during transit, which can affect the package’s dimensional weight and surcharge eligibility. If the service selected, weight entered or dimensions entered are incorrect or change during transit, we may make appropriate adjustments to the shipment charges at any time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">2.     Default Billing. Senders are solely responsible for accurately completing all sections of the air waybill and for the entry of accurate shipment information into any electronic shipping device. If you fail to provide or correctly enter this information, you will be billed and agree to pay based on our estimate of the number of packages transported and either the dimensional weight at the time of billing or a standard default weight-per-package estimate, both of which will be determined by us at our sole discretion. If no service is marked, we will send your shipment via FedEx International Priority, FedEx International Economy, FedEx International Priority Freight or FedEx International Economy Freight service as selected by us at our sole discretion.<br />
<br />
For FedEx International Priority and FedEx International Economy services, the recipient's postal code is critical to correct invoicing (to those countries that are in multiple rate scales). Any omission or incorrect entry will result in a billing based on a default postal code.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">3.     Our money-back guarantee policy governs and is the exclusive remedy for requests for refunds or credits related to service failures. (See the Money-Back Guarantee Policy section for applicable notice provisions and other conditions.) If the money-back guarantee is suspended or revoked, there is no remedy.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">4.     Requests for invoice adjustments due to an overcharge must be received within 60 days after the original invoice date (or ship date if prepaid by cash, check, money order or credit card).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">5.     FedEx is not obligated to refund any overcharge or pay any other obligation owed when your FedEx account is, or has been in the past, more than 60 days past due.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">6.     If your account is more than 60 days past due, FedEx may, at its sole discretion, apply any overcharge amounts or other overpayments it agrees are owed to you against the oldest invoices.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">7.     You may request an invoice adjustment for reasons not related to a service failure in the following ways:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">a.    Use our internet application FedEx Billing Online at fedex.com if you are a registered user; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">b.    Submit your request through the invoice adjustment feature at fedex.com; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">c.    Submit the request via fedex.com/us/customersupport/email/express_ground.html (select Billing/Invoicing as the category). All adjustment requests must state the reason an adjustment or refund is warranted and must provide the following:  the FedEx account number (if any); the FedEx tracking number; and the date of shipment; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">d.    Submit the request via our telephone invoice adjustment system at <b><a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a> </b>(say &quot;billing&quot;). If you choose to submit your request via the telephone invoice adjustment system, the request must state the reason an adjustment or refund is warranted and must provide the following: the FedEx account number (if any); the FedEx tracking number; and the date of shipment; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">e.    Send your request to:<br />
<br />
FedEx<br />
Revenue Services<br />
3965 Airways Boulevard<br />
Module G<br />
Memphis, TN 38116<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">f.    You may also send your request via fax to the FedEx toll-free fax service: <b>1.800.548.3020</b><a href="tel:18005483020"></a>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">A partial payment against an invoice is not considered a request for invoice adjustment or notice of a refund request.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">8.     We will not be liable for any invoice adjustment unless you comply with the notice requirements described above. The filing of a lawsuit against us does not constitute compliance with these notice provisions.<br />
<br />
For additional information or assistance regarding billing issues, contact FedEx Revenue Services at <b><a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a></b> (say &quot;billing&quot;), 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. (CST), Monday through Friday.</p>
<p>Q.   <b>Additional Taxes.</b> If a value-added, consumption or similar tax is applicable to your shipment, we reserve the right to add that amount to your shipping charges without notice. We pay any applicable excise tax on the air transportation portion of our service.</p>
<p>R.   The shipper and any other party who is liable for payment are responsible for all reasonable costs incurred by FedEx in obtaining or attempting to obtain payment for services rendered by us. Such costs include, but are not limited to, attorneys' fees, collection agency fees, interest and court costs.</p>
<p>S.   At our sole discretion, FedEx may transfer and assign ownership of, and any rights to collect, any and all charges due and payable to us.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    As used in the FedEx Express terms and conditions, &quot;Warsaw Convention&quot; means the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules relating to International Carriage by Air, signed at Warsaw, Oct. 12, 1929, or that convention as amended, including the Montreal Protocol No. 4. &quot;Montreal Convention&quot; means the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules relating to International Carriage by Air, signed at Montreal, May 28, 1999. &quot;Carrier&quot; includes the air carrier issuing the air waybill and all air carriers that carry the goods or perform any other services related to the carriage.</p>
<p>B.    When the carriage involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the Warsaw Convention or Montreal Convention may be applicable. The convention governs and, in most cases, limits our liability for loss of, damage to or delay of cargo.</p>
<p>C.    The Warsaw Convention and the Montreal Convention limit our liability for loss or delay of or damage to your shipment, unless you declare a higher value for carriage and pay the required fee as described below. The interpretation of the relevant Convention's liability limit may vary depending on the destination country. If the Warsaw Convention as amended by Montreal Protocol No. 4 applies to your shipment, our liability is limited to 17 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) per kilo, unless you declare a higher value for carriage and pay the required fee. If the Montreal Convention applies to your shipment, our liability is limited to 19 SDRs per kilo, unless you declare a higher value for carriage and pay the required fee. Otherwise, our liability is limited to US$9.07 per pound (US$20.00 per kilo) unless you declare a higher value for carriage and pay the required fee.</p>
<p>D.    To the extent not in conflict with the rules relating to liability for international carriage as established by the Warsaw Convention or the Montreal Convention, carriage and other services performed by us are subject to the provisions of the FedEx Service Guide and applicable tariffs as amended from time to time, which are incorporated in the FedEx Service Guide by reference. The tariffs, if any, may be inspected at our corporate headquarters in Memphis, Tenn.</p>
<p>FedEx assumes no obligation to carry the goods by any specified aircraft or over any particular route or to make connections at any point according to any schedules. You agree FedEx may, without notice, substitute alternative carrier or aircraft, deviate from the route or routes, or cause the goods to be transported by motor vehicle.<br />

THERE ARE NO STOPPING PLACES THAT ARE AGREED TO AT THE TIME OF TENDER OF THE SHIPMENT, AND WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO ROUTE THE SHIPMENT IN ANY WAY WE DEEM APPROPRIATE.<br />

(See the Money-Back Guarantee Policy section for the time period to request a refund or credit of transportation charges due to a service failure.) We must receive notice of all other claims, including, but not limited to, claims for nondelivery or misdelivery, within nine months after the package was tendered to FedEx Express for shipment.</p>
<p>B.  Notice of claims for which you are seeking more than US$100 must be in writing. All claims must be made within the time limits set forth above.</p>
<p>C.  Your notice of claim must include complete shipper and recipient information, as well as the FedEx tracking number, date of shipment, number of pieces, and shipment weight. Failure to provide us with notice in the manner and within the time limits set forth in paragraphs (A) through (B) will result in denial of your claim, and we will have no liability or obligation to pay your claim. The filing of a lawsuit does not constitute compliance with these notice provisions.</p>
<p>D.  Written documentation supporting the amount of your claim must be delivered to us within nine months after the package was tendered to FedEx Express for shipment. Such documentation may include original purchase invoices, estimates or invoices for repair, expense statements, appraisals, final confirmation screen if online order with proof of purchase, or other records. These documents must be verifiable to our satisfaction.</p>
<p>E.  We are not obligated to act on any claim until all transportation charges have been paid. The claim amount may not be deducted from these charges or from any outstanding balance owed to us.</p>
<p>F.  FedEx reserves the right to inspect a damaged shipment on the recipient's premises as well as the right to retrieve the damaged package for inspection at a FedEx facility. The terms and conditions applicable to the original shipment (including any declared value) will govern the disposition of all claims in connection with the shipment, including any claim relative to the retrieval, inspection or return of the package. When a package is picked up for inspection, a receipt for the damaged package will be provided if requested by the recipient. All of the original shipping cartons, packing and contents must be made available for our inspection and retained until the claim is concluded. FedEx reserves the right to request a self-inspection requiring proof of damage in the form of photographs of the carton, inner packaging and damaged contents. If requested, this documentation must be delivered to us within nine months after the package was tendered to FedEx Express for shipment.</p>
<p>G.  Except in the case of concealed damage, receipt of the shipment by the recipient without written notice of damage on the air waybill is prima facie evidence that the shipment was delivered in good condition.</p>
<p>H.  We do not accept claims from customers whose packages were sent through a package consolidator. (See the Package Consolidators section.)</p>
<p>I.  Shipment-status information is not intended or permitted to be used as the basis to file a claim.</p>
<p>J.  Only one claim can be filed in connection with a shipment. Acceptance of payment of a claim shall extinguish any right to recover in connection with that shipment.</p>
<p>K.  When we resolve a claim by paying full value for a shipment, we reserve the right to pick up the package for salvage, and all rights, title to, and interest in the package shall vest with us.</p>
<p>L.  You can file a claim in the following ways:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.   Submit claims online at fedex.com/us/claimsonline for U.S. export shipments to all countries served by FedEx Express and U.S.-inbound shipments from Canada.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.   Send written claims, including the completed claim form and supporting documentation, via the U.S. Postal Service or fax to:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">FedEx Cargo Claims Department<br />

Pittsburgh, PA 15230<br />
Fax: <b>1.877.229.4766</b><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">If you fax your completed claim form and supporting documentation, FedEx will send you a confirmation letter by return fax.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.   Call customer service at <a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a> (say &quot;claims&quot;) to obtain a case number for your claim, then complete a print copy of the claim form. You may have to submit supporting documentation using FedEx Claims Online or the mailing address or fax number listed above.</p>
<p>M.   FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THE ABOVE CONDITIONS WILL RESULT IN THE DENIAL OF YOUR CLAIM.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    We do not provide individual consumer credit privileges.</p>
<p>B.    As a condition of extending credit privileges, FedEx reserves the right to require business customers to provide current financial information, agree to bank draft arrangements for payment on account, provide a security deposit or provide a bank letter of credit.</p>
<p>C.    When credit privileges are extended, FedEx reserves the right to establish and enforce a credit limit on your account. At our sole discretion, we may review and amend a credit limit on your account.</p>
<p>D.    The invoice date begins the credit term cycle, and payment for transportation charges is due within 15 days from the invoice date. Failure to keep your FedEx account current will result in your account being placed on cash-only status. This status may impair your ability to use our services, delay your shipments and may result in the loss of any applicable discounts.<br />
<br />
Duties, taxes and other fees are payable immediately upon receipt of our invoice. If transportation charges and duties and taxes are on the same invoice, all charges are due upon receipt of invoice.</p>
<p>E.    IF THE ACCOUNT NUMBER TO BE BILLED IS NOT IN GOOD CREDIT STANDING, THE PACKAGE MAY BE REFUSED, HELD OR STOPPED IN TRANSIT UNTIL YOU MAKE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS. THE MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE POLICY WILL NOT APPLY IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES.</p>
<p>F.    The shipper, and any other party who is liable for payment, is responsible for all reasonable costs incurred by FedEx in obtaining or attempting to obtain payment for services rendered by us. Such costs include, but are not limited to, attorneys' fees, collection agency fees, interest and court costs.</p>
<p>G.    Credit privileges will not be restored until you have paid all past-due balances in full and all costs, fees and expenses incurred by FedEx in collecting or attempting to collect such balances. FedEx may require you to secure the account with a form of payment as a prerequisite to credit restoration. FedEx may decline to restore credit privileges even if all costs, fees and expenses are paid.</p>
<p>H.    Customers requesting removal from cash-only status must contact the FedEx Recovery Collections department at <b><a href="tel:18005067580">1.800.506.7580</a></b>.</p>
<p>I.      We may apply payments made on your account to any unpaid invoice issued on your account, at our sole discretion.</p>
<p>J.     Requests for research or refunds of payment must be received within 60 days from the date of payment.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    All shipments that cross international borders must be cleared through customs, and you may also be required to provide additional information to obtain clearance from other regulatory agencies in the destination country prior to delivery to the recipient.</p>
<p>B.    Except as provided under the FedEx International Broker Select section at fedex.com, we (or a broker selected by us) will submit shipments to customs and other regulatory agencies for clearance. Duties and taxes or fees that may be assessed by any regulatory agency may be advanced on behalf of the sender and recipient provided appropriate credit arrangements have been made in advance. (See the Billing and Duties and Taxes sections.) FedEx may charge an ancillary clearance service fee, where applicable, on international shipments for clearance processing, for services requested by the shipper, recipient or importer of record, or to recover the costs passed to FedEx by the regulatory agency for regulatory filing. The types and amounts of fees vary by country. (See fedex.com/ancillary/go/service for a list of ancillary clearance service fees in your destination country.)</p>
<p>C.    In some instances, at our option, we accept instructions from recipients to use a designated customs broker other than FedEx (or the broker selected by FedEx) or the broker designated by the shipper. In any event, FedEx (or the broker selected by FedEx) reserves the right to clear the shipment if the broker cannot be determined or will not perform clearance or if complete broker information is not provided (including name, address, phone number and postal code).</p>
<p>D.    When shipments are held by customs or other agencies due to incorrect or missing documentation, we may attempt first to notify the recipient. If local law requires the correct information or documentation to be submitted by the recipient and the recipient fails to do so within a reasonable time as we may determine, the shipment may be considered undeliverable. (See the Undeliverable Shipments section.) If the recipient fails to supply the required information or documentation, and local law allows the sender to provide the same, we may attempt to notify the sender. If the sender also fails to provide the information or documentation within a reasonable time as we may determine, the shipment will be considered undeliverable. We assume no responsibility for our inability to complete a delivery due to incorrect or missing documentation, whether or not we attempt to notify the recipient or sender. (See the Undeliverable Shipments section.)</p>
<p>E.    Shipments requiring documentation in addition to the FedEx International Air Waybill, the FedEx International Next Flight Air Waybill or the FedEx International MailService Air Waybill (e.g., a Commercial Invoice) may require additional transit time. Proper completion of necessary documentation, with complete and accurate shipment information, including the appropriate Harmonized Tariff Schedule Code, is the shipper's responsibility.</p>
<p>F.    Shipments that contain goods or products that are regulated by multiple government agencies within the destination country (such as the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Federal Communications Commission in the U.S. and comparable agencies in the destination country) may require additional time for clearance.</p>
<p>G.    The sender is responsible for making sure goods shipped internationally are acceptable for entry into the destination country. All charges for shipment to and return from countries where entry is not permitted are the sender's responsibility.</p>
<p>H.    We assume no responsibility for shipments abandoned in customs, and such shipments may be considered undeliverable.</p>
<p>I.      If acceptable wildlife products are shipped via the FedEx International Broker Select service option for U.S. import, they must be addressed to a broker at one of the 18 designated U.S. Fish and Wildlife ports.</p>
<p>J.     U.S. import shipments that contain products that originate from wildlife or contain wildlife may require original permits/certificates (CITES) for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service clearance. U.S. importers of wildlife products must obtain an import license from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for commercial shipments.</p>
<p>K.    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires completion of FDA Prior Notice for certain shipments containing food or food articles for human or animal consumption prior to their arrival in the U.S. A copy of the FDA Prior Notice confirmation record must be included with the shipping documentation for all foods and food products that require Prior Notice.</p>
<p>L.     For shipments that must be cleared through customs by the recipient, FedEx will deliver the customs paperwork to the recipient, and delivery of paperwork constitutes timely delivery.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    All packages containing dangerous goods must comply with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulations and, where applicable, Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Shippers of dangerous goods, whether prepared under ICAO/IATA or 49CFR, must comply with all FedEx Express variations listed in the current edition of the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations. All packages containing dangerous goods must comply with the IATA dangerous-goods regulations. The only exception is for a U.S. territory or commonwealth such as Puerto Rico. Shippers may use 49CFR when prepared by air as limited by the commodities FedEx Express accepts prepared under these regulations. The shipper is responsible for complying with all packing requirements and appropriate marking and labeling of the package, documentation, as well as compliance with all applicable local, state and federal laws, regulations, ordinances and rules. The shipper is also responsible for ensuring the recipient complies with all applicable local, state and federal laws, regulations, ordinances and rules for applicable hazard classes.<br />
<br />
Dangerous goods can only be shipped using the FedEx Expanded Service International Air Waybill when using a paper air waybill for express service.</p>
<p>B.    Shippers must comply with all applicable local, state and federal laws governing packing, marking and labeling of shipments of blood and blood products, regardless of whether they are infectious.</p>
<p>C.    FedEx packaging may not be used to ship dangerous goods (including dry ice), with the following exceptions:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     Permitted IATA Section II lithium batteries, which may be shipped in FedEx boxes and tubes; and</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     Biological Substance, Category B (UN 3373) shipments, which may be shipped in the FedEx UN 3373 Pak, the FedEx Medium Clinical Box, the FedEx Large Clinical Box or the following FedEx Temp-Assure cold shipping boxes: Small Cold Box Standard Duration; Medium Cold Box Standard Duration; Medium Cold Box Extended Duration; Large Cold Box Standard Duration; and Large Cold Box Extended Duration.</p>
<p>Blood, urine and other specimens containing infectious substances are considered dangerous goods and must not be shipped in the FedEx Clinical Pak. The shipper assumes sole responsibility for compliance with all applicable governmental regulations. For more information on FedEx guidelines, go to fedex.com/packaging and read our brochures on packaging clinical samples and Biological Substance, UN 3373 specimens.</p>
<p>D.    FedEx Express does not accept dangerous goods shipments prepared exclusively for ground shipment.</p>
<p>E.    FedEx is not required to add dry ice to packages in its system or to provide re-icing services.</p>
<p>F.    Each shipment must be accompanied by the 8-1/2&quot; Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods form when required. Title 49CFR paperwork cannot be used for international dangerous goods shipments (except for a U.S. territory or commonwealth such as Puerto Rico), and such shipments will be refused or returned to the sender.</p>
<p>G.    Lithium batteries (UN 3090) that are Primary Non-Rechargeable require pre-approval to ship. This applies to IATA Section IA and Section IB lithium batteries. For details, go to fedex.com and enter keyword &quot;lithium batteries.&quot; FedEx Express does not accept UN 3090 and UN 3480 lithium batteries tendered as IATA Section II shipments; they must be tendered as fully regulated IATA Section IA or IB. In addition, FedEx Express does not accept waste batteries or batteries being shipped for recycling or disposal, including damaged or defective batteries (see IATA variation FX–04).</p>
<p>H.    FedEx may require shippers to hire a trained pack-and-ship vendor to resolve a problem with an undeliverable dangerous goods shipment. If the recipient refuses a package or freight piece containing dangerous goods, or the package leaks or is damaged, it will be returned to the shipper if possible. If the shipper refuses to accept the returned shipment or it cannot be returned because of leakage or damage due to faulty packaging, the shipper is responsible for and agrees to reimburse and otherwise indemnify FedEx for all costs, fees, and expenses it incurs in connection with the cleanup and disposal of the package or freight piece. The shipper agrees to indemnify FedEx for any and all costs, fees and expenses FedEx incurs as a result of the shipper's failure to comply with FedEx Dangerous Goods shipping requirements.</p>
<p>I.      We have the right to refuse any package or freight piece with an odor or any package that is wet or leaking. If a dangerous goods shipment damages or contaminates any property, the shipper is solely responsible for and will reimburse and indemnify FedEx for any and all costs, fees and expenses it incurs in connection with the cleanup of such damage or contamination.</p>
<p>J.     Not all FedEx locations accept dangerous goods, and we reserve the right to refuse dangerous goods at any location where they cannot be accepted in accordance with applicable law. Dangerous goods shipments, including dry ice, are not allowed at FedEx Drop Box locations, FedEx Office Print and Ship Center locations, FedEx Authorized ShipCenter locations, FedEx OnSite locations, or FedEx ShipSite locations, except as noted below:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     Biological Substance, Category B (UN 3373) shipments are allowed at select FedEx Office Print and Ship Center locations (contact your local FedEx Office Print and Ship Center for service availability) and may be placed in FedEx Drop Boxes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     FedEx Express shipments containing permitted IATA Section II lithium batteries are allowed at FedEx Office Print and Ship Center locations and may be placed in FedEx Drop Boxes.</p>
<p>K.    The shipper must provide all required information and complete all boxes pertaining to dangerous goods on the FedEx air waybill. Shippers utilizing electronic systems to ship dangerous goods must select, as appropriate to the electronic system, the special services, handling or flag to indicate that their shipment contains dangerous goods.</p>
<p>L.     <i>Note:</i> We are required by law to report improperly declared or undeclared shipments of dangerous goods to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The shipper may be subject to fines and penalties under applicable law. The DOT/Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires every shipper to have job-specific dangerous goods training prior to tendering a dangerous goods shipment to FedEx or another air carrier. When individuals tender a shipment containing dangerous goods it must be properly classified, packaged, marked, labeled and identified as dangerous goods, and include the correct dangerous goods documentation.</p>
<p>M.   Dangerous goods may not be rerouted to an address other than the original intended-recipient's address provided by the shipper. (<i>Note</i>: Shipments may be made available as hold for pickup at permissible locations or be returned to the sender.)</p>
<p>N.    We are required to maintain proper segregation of incompatible dangerous goods on all vehicles and aircraft. This necessity may cause the shipment to move on the next available truck route or flight on which proper segregation can be maintained.</p>
<p>O.    For more information, see Shipping Dangerous Goods via FedEx Express at fedex.com/dangerousgoods. If you have questions regarding shipments of dangerous goods, you may call <a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a> and say &quot;dangerous goods&quot; to connect to our Dangerous Goods/Hazardous Materials Hotline for assistance (outside the U.S. call <a href="tel:19013756806">1.901.375.6806</a>). If you have questions regarding countries served, commodity restrictions by country or service availability, call <a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a> and say &quot;international services&quot; for FedEx International Customer Service.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>The declared value for carriage of any package represents our maximum liability in connection with a shipment of that package, including, but not limited to, any loss, damage, delay, misdelivery, nondelivery, misinformation, any failure to provide information, or misdelivery of information relating to the shipment. It is the shipper's responsibility to prove actual damages. Exposure to and risk of any loss in excess of the declared value is assumed by the shipper. You may transfer this risk to an insurance carrier of your choice through the purchase of an insurance policy. Contact an insurance agent or broker if you desire insurance coverage. WE DO NOT PROVIDE INSURANCE COVERAGE OF ANY KIND.</p>
<p>A.  If for any reason the Warsaw Convention or the Montreal Convention (see the Carriage Under International Conventions section) does not govern our liability, our maximum liability for loss, damage or delay, or any claim with regard to any shipment moving to or from the U.S. is limited to US$100, US$9.07 per pound or US$20.00 per kilo, whichever is greater, unless you declare a higher value for carriage and pay a greater charge. The interpretation of the relevant Convention's liability limit may vary depending on the destination country. If the Warsaw Convention as amended by Montreal Protocol No. 4 applies to your shipment, our liability is limited to 17 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) per kilo, unless you declare a higher value for carriage and pay the required fee. If the Montreal Convention applies to your shipment, our liability is limited to 19 SDRs per kilo, unless you declare a higher value for carriage and pay the required fee. Otherwise, our liability is limited to US$9.07 per pound (US$20.00 per kilo) unless you declare a higher value for carriage and pay the required fee.</p>
<p>FedEx International Priority Freight and FedEx International Economy Freight shipments have a maximum declared-value limit of US$100,000 to most destinations. FedEx International Broker Select shipments to many countries are allowed to exceed the country declared-value-for-carriage limit (but not the FedEx International Priority and FedEx International Economy maximum of US$50,000 per shipment).<br />
<br />
Except as limited below, unless a higher value is declared and paid for, our liability for each package shipped between Puerto Rico and the U.S. is limited to US$100. For each package exceeding US$100 in declared value, an additional amount will be charged. See Rates in the FedEx Service Guide for details.<br />
<br />
Except as limited below, the declared-value limit for shipments between Puerto Rico and the U.S. is US$50,000 per shipment, rather than US$50,000 per package.<br />
<br />
For packages shipped between Puerto Rico and the U.S., or sent to any international location, the declared value for carriage cannot be greater than the declared value for customs. A FedEx Envelope and FedEx Pak to and from Puerto Rico is limited to a declared value for customs and carriage of US$100.</p>
<p>B.   If you declare a higher value for carriage, an additional amount will be assessed for each US$100 (or fraction thereof) by which the declared value for carriage exceeds the US$100 or US$9.07 per-pound liability limitation, whichever is applicable. See Rates in the FedEx Service Guide for details. EVEN IF A HIGHER VALUE IS DECLARED, OUR LIABILITY FOR LOSS, DAMAGE OR DELAY OF A SHIPMENT WILL NOT EXCEED ITS REPAIR COSTS, ITS DEPRECIATED VALUE OR ITS REPLACEMENT COST, WHICHEVER IS LESS.</p>
<p>C.  The maximum declared value for customs and carriage for the contents of a FedEx Envelope or a FedEx Pak, regardless of destination, is US$100 or US$9.07 per pound, whichever is greater. Goods with a value (actual or declared) exceeding US$100 should not be shipped in a FedEx Envelope or FedEx Pak.</p>
<p>D.  The maximum declared value for customs and carriage for a FedEx international shipment, if other than a FedEx Envelope or FedEx Pak, can be found at fedex.com under the individual country listing.</p>
<p>Except as limited below, the maximum declared value per shipment for FedEx International Next Flight is US$50,000. If a FedEx International Next Flight shipment is tendered to FedEx palletized or shrinkwrapped as one single unit, the maximum declared value is US$50,000. If more than one FedEx International Next Flight package is shipped on one air waybill, the declared value for carriage of each package will be determined by dividing the total declared value for carriage by the number of packages in the shipment; the liability of FedEx for loss or damage will be limited to the actual value of the package(s) lost or damaged, not to exceed the per-package declared value.</p>
<p>E.  Shipments (packages or freight) containing all or part of the following items are limited to a maximum declared value for carriage of US$1,000 per shipment or US$9.07 per pound, whichever is greater. Import of any of the following items may be prohibited by individual countries, and a lower declared-value limitation for a country will control this stated limitation for such items:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.   Artwork, including any work created or developed by the application of skill, taste or creative talent for sale, display or collection. This includes, but is not limited to, items (and their parts) such as paintings, drawings, vases, tapestries, limited-edition prints, fine art, statuary, sculpture and collector's items.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.   Film, photographic images (including photographic negatives), photographic chromes and photographic slides</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.   Any commodity that by its inherent nature is particularly susceptible to damage or the market value of which is particularly variable or difficult to ascertain.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.   Antiques, or any commodity that exhibits the style or fashion of a past era and whose history, age or rarity contributes to its value. These items include, but are not limited to, furniture, tableware and glassware.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.   Glassware, including, but not limited to, signs, mirrors, ceramics, porcelains, china, crystal, glass, framed glass, and any other commodity with similarly fragile qualities.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.   Plasma screens.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">7.   Jewelry, including, but not limited to, costume jewelry, watches and their parts, mount gems or stones (precious or semiprecious), industrial diamonds, and jewelry made of precious metal.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">8.   Furs, including, but not limited to, fur clothing, fur-trimmed clothing and fur pelts.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">9.   Precious metals, including, but not limited to, gold and silver bullion or dust, precipitates, or platinum (except as an integral part of electronic machinery).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">10.  Stocks, bonds, cash letters or cash equivalents, including, but not limited to, food stamps, postage stamps (not collectible), traveler's checks, lottery tickets, money orders, gift cards and gift certificates, prepaid calling cards (excluding those that require a code for activation), bond coupons, and bearer bonds.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">11.  Liquor stamps and tax stamps.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">12.  Collector's items such as coins, stamps, sports cards, souvenirs and memorabilia.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">13.  Guitars and other musical instruments that are more than 20 years old, and customized or personalized musical instruments.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">14.  Scale models (including, but not limited to, architectural models and dollhouses) and prototypes.</p>
<p>F.  The declared value for carriage cannot be greater than the declared value for customs.</p>
<p>G.  When the sender has not specified the declared value for carriage of each package on an air waybill, but has specified a total declared value for all packages, the declared value for each package will be determined by dividing the total declared value by the number of packages on the air waybill unless you provide verifiable evidence supporting a different allocation. The declared value of any package in a shipment cannot exceed the declared value of the total shipment.</p>
<p>H.  Notwithstanding anything else in the FedEx Service Guide, we are not liable for any loss of, damage to or delay, misdelivery or nondelivery of unacceptable shipments, including, but not limited to, cash or currency, nor misdelivery of information.</p>
<p>I.  Notwithstanding anything else in the FedEx Service Guide, we are not liable for any loss, damage or delay to any package that is not adequately packaged by the shipper.</p>
<p>J.  ANY EFFORT TO DECLARE A VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE MAXIMUMS ALLOWED IN THE FEDEX SERVICE GUIDE IS NULL AND VOID. OUR ACCEPTANCE FOR CARRIAGE OF ANY SHIPMENT BEARING A DECLARED VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE ALLOWED MAXIMUMS DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF ANY PROVISION OF THE FEDEX SERVICE GUIDE AS TO SUCH SHIPMENT.</p>
<p>K.  REGARDLESS OF THE DECLARED VALUE OF A PACKAGE, OUR LIABILITY FOR LOSS, DAMAGE, DELAY, MISDELIVERY, NONDELIVERY, MISINFORMATION, ANY FAILURE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION, OR MISDELIVERY OF INFORMATION, WILL NOT EXCEED A SHIPMENT'S REPAIR COST, ITS DEPRECIATED VALUE OR ITS REPLACEMENT COST, WHICHEVER IS LESS.</p>
<p>L.  The shipper is responsible for accurately completing the air waybill or other shipping documents, including completion of the declared-value section. We cannot honor requests to change the declared-value information on the air waybill after tender to FedEx.</p>
<p>M.  See the Liabilities Not Assumed section for other limitations and exclusions on our liability.</p>
<p>N.  Additional restrictions may apply to a shipment if sent pursuant to an airline interline agreement.</p>
<p>O.  In the event that FedEx Office procures, accepts tender of, performs, or otherwise undertakes the transportation, delivery or release of a package by FedEx Express, whether directly or indirectly, FedEx Office shall have the benefit of every right, defense, limitation and liberty of whatsoever nature contained in these terms and conditions or otherwise available to FedEx Express as if such provision were expressly for its benefit.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>FedEx offers Delivery Signature Options for shippers. Not available for all shipments or to all destinations.</p>
<p>A.    <b>Indirect Signature Required.</b> FedEx will obtain a signature in one of three ways:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     From someone at the delivery address; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     From a neighbor, building manager or other person at a neighboring address; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     Where available, the recipient can sign a FedEx door tag or utilize other FedEx-approved means to authorize release of the package without anyone present.</p>
<p>If delivery cannot be completed in these ways, FedEx may reattempt delivery.</p>
<p>B.    <b>Direct Signature Required.</b> FedEx will obtain a signature from someone at the delivery address. If no one is at the address, FedEx may reattempt delivery.</p>
<p>C.    <b>Adult Signature Required.</b> FedEx will obtain a signature from someone at the delivery address who is at least the age of majority in the destination country. Government-issued photo identification or other identification customarily accepted by local authorities is required. In all cases, if there is no eligible recipient at the delivery address, FedEx may reattempt delivery.</p>
<p>D.    Shipments to residential addresses may be released without obtaining a signature. If you require a signature for a residential shipment, select one of the Delivery Signature Options.</p>
<p>E.    Choosing a Delivery Signature Option overrides a signature release.</p>
<p>F.    FedEx will assess the delivery signature charge if the shipper requests the Delivery Signature Option, even if a signature is not obtained, the option requested is not available or FedEx is unable to provide a copy of the signature obtained at delivery.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    In order to complete clearance of certain items through customs, we may be required to advance on your behalf certain duties and taxes as assessed by customs officials. For all shipments we may contact the payer before clearance is complete to confirm the arrangements for reimbursing us. At our sole discretion, we may require confirmation of reimbursement arrangements as a condition to completion of clearance and delivery including, but not limited to, cases of deliveries to recipients that we believe are not creditworthy and of shipments with high declared values.</p>
<p>B.    Duties and taxes may generally be billed to the sender, the recipient or a third party. If the sender fails to designate a payer on the air waybill, duties and taxes will automatically be billed to the recipient where allowed. Bill Sender Duties and Taxes and Bill Third Party Duties and Taxes are options available only for deliveries to specified locations (call FedEx Express International Customer Service at<b> <a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a></b> and say &quot;international services&quot;). REGARDLESS OF ANY PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CONTRARY, THE SENDER IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYMENT OF DUTIES AND TAXES IF PAYMENT IS NOT RECEIVED. If transportation charges for a shipment are billed to a credit card, FedEx reserves the right to also settle uncollected duties and taxes charges associated with that shipment to the credit card account.</p>
<p>C.    In the event we advance duties, taxes or other fees, including the U.S. Merchandise Processing Fee, on behalf of the payer, the payer will be assessed an ancillary clearance service fee based on a flat rate or a percentage of the total amount advanced. This ancillary clearance service fee will vary depending upon the destination country. See the Advancement Fee listed under Ancillary Clearance Service Fees in the FedEx Service Guide for the surcharge that applies to U.S. import shipments.</p>
<p>D.    Shipments marked Bill Recipient Duties and Taxes may be delayed if we are not able to reach the recipient to confirm that we will be reimbursed for any amounts advanced, and the money-back guarantee will not apply in these cases. (See the Liabilities Not Assumed and Money-Back Guarantee Policy sections.)</p>
<p>E.    If a recipient refuses to pay the duties and taxes, we may contact the sender. If the sender refuses to make satisfactory arrangements to reimburse us, the shipment may be returned to the sender or placed into a general order warehouse or a customs-bonded warehouse. The sender must then pay both the original transportation charges and the return charges. If we advanced any amounts as duties and taxes at either the original destination or upon return, the sender shall also be liable for such amounts.</p>
<p>F.    Payment for duties and taxes will be made by one of the following means at the sole discretion of FedEx: cash, check (personal or business, provided valid identification is offered), credit card, money order, traveler's check, or debit or deferment account. FedEx does not accept prepayment of duties and taxes at the time of shipment.</p>
<p>G.    In the event that we require confirmation of duties and taxes reimbursement arrangements from the recipient, we will attempt to contact the recipient no later than 12 p.m. on the day the shipment is available for customs clearance in the destination country and inform the recipient of the estimated duties and taxes amount. If an arrangement satisfactory to us is made, the shipment will then be cleared through customs and delivered. If the shipment clears customs by 5 p.m. on the day arrangements are confirmed, delivery will be scheduled for the next business day by 5 p.m. or the end of the local business day. In the event we have cleared packages on your behalf and you do not have credit arrangements with FedEx, payment may be required prior to the release of your shipment.</p>
<p>H.    In the event the accuracy or propriety of duties and taxes assessed on a shipment is disputed, FedEx or its designated broker may review the shipping documents tendered with the shipment. If FedEx determines that the duties and taxes were properly assessed, the shipper agrees to pay the duties and taxes.<br />

You are responsible for, and warrant, your compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the U.S. Foreign Assets Control Regulations and applicable export laws and regulations of any country to, from, through or over which your shipment may be transported. You agree, and warrant, that you will comply with all applicable U.S. government sanctions prohibiting the export or re-export of goods, services or technology to countries and regions listed by the U.S. government unilaterally or in coordination with other countries’ sanctions. In addition, no commodities originating or manufactured in any of these countries and regions are accepted for transportation anywhere in the world. For a current list of sanctioned countries and regions go to fedex.com/us/international-resource-center/internationalfaq.html.</p>
<p>Any FedEx Returns service shipments that are forwarded to a third country must also comply with the export control requirements of the country of first departure. You agree to furnish such information and complete and attach to the air waybill such documents as necessary to comply with such laws, rules and regulations.</p>
<p>In addition, you specifically warrant that you will not tender any shipments to us if you or any of the parties involved in the shipment are listed on any of the export controls or sanctions lists published and maintained by: the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control; the U.S. Department of Commerce Department, Bureau of Industry and Security; the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls; the United Nations Sanctions Committees; the European Union Council; and any other relevant authority. In addition, you agree and warrant that you will not attempt to ship to any entity owned by any party, in the common ownership interest determined by the relevant listing authority, subject to U.S. government economic sanctions.</p>
<p>Any shipments requiring a U.S. Department of State license or authorization, or requiring a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration export permit, and certain in-bond shipments, must be shipped using our FedEx International Controlled Export service option, only available with FedEx International Priority, FedEx International Priority Freight or FedEx International Priority DirectDistribution services. For further information, go to the FedEx International Controlled Export section on fedex.com/en-us/service-guide/special-handling-services.html.</p>
<p>You agree to identify any shipments requiring any other U.S. government export license or permit, and shipments subject to such pre-export regulatory controls and provide us with information and all necessary documentation to comply with the applicable U.S. laws and regulations. You are responsible at your expense for determining U.S. export licensing or permitting requirements for a shipment, obtaining any required U.S. export licenses or permits, and ensuring that the consignee is authorized as required by the applicable laws and regulations of the origin country, destination country, and any country(s) asserting jurisdiction over the goods.</p>
<p>We assume no liability to you or any other person for any loss or expense — including, but not limited to, fines and penalties — if you fail to comply with any export laws, rules or regulations.</p>

<p>Any right you might have to damages, refunds, credits, recovery of reliance interests, disgorgement, restitution, injunctive relief, declaratory relief or any other legal or equitable relief whatsoever against us under any cause of action arising from the transportation of any package pursuant to the FedEx Service Guide shall be extinguished unless you file an action within one year from the date of delivery of the shipment or from the date on which the shipment should have been delivered.</p>
<p>Any right that you might have to damages, refunds, credits, recovery of reliance interests, disgorgement, restitution, injunctive relief, declaratory relief or any other legal or equitable relief whatsoever against us under any cause of action arising from the transportation of any package pursuant to the FedEx Service Guide shall be extinguished unless you first comply with all applicable notice periods and requirements in these terms and conditions including, but not limited to, the periods and requirements for providing notice under the Billing, Claims and Money-Back Guarantee Policy sections. You and we understand that timely and complete compliance with such notice periods and requirements is a contractual condition precedent to your right to any relief whatsoever, and you must plead compliance with those conditions precedent on the face of any complaint that you file against us. You and we agree that FedEx cannot be considered to have breached any obligation to you unless or until we wrongfully deny a claim submitted to us pursuant to the notice periods and requirements contained in these terms and conditions. Finally, you and we agree that you will comply with applicable notice periods and requirements even if you believe that such compliance will not result in relief from us or if you lack knowledge regarding whether such compliance will result in relief from us.</p>
<p>You agree that you will not sue us as a class plaintiff or class representative, join as a class member, or participate as an adverse party in any way in a class-action lawsuit against us. Nothing in this paragraph, however, limits your rights to bring a lawsuit as an individual plaintiff.</p>
<p>To the extent that any court finds that state rather than federal law applies to any provision of this contract, the controlling law is the substantive law of the state in which you tendered your shipment to us.</p>
<p>The performance of any services does not make us an agent of the shipper or any third party for any purpose.<br />

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>We offer a money-back guarantee for our services1. This guarantee can be suspended, modified or revoked at our sole discretion without prior notice to you.</p>
<p>A.    <b>Money-Back Guarantee.</b> For U.S.-based payers, we will, at our option, and upon request, either refund or credit to the applicable invoice only your transportation charges if we deliver a shipment 60 seconds or more after the applicable delivery commitment time. The money-back guarantee applies to shipments tendered using the following services: FedEx International First, FedEx International Next Flight, FedEx International Priority, FedEx International Priority Freight, FedEx International Economy, FedEx International Economy Freight, FedEx International Priority DirectDistribution, FedEx International Priority DirectDistribution Freight and FedEx International Premium. It does not apply to FedEx International MailService. This money-back guarantee is your exclusive remedy in the event of a service failure for the recovery of all or any portion of the FedEx charges for a shipment. If the money-back guarantee is suspended, there is no remedy or recovery of charges for a service failure. There are no delivery commitments for shipments on which the money-back guarantee is suspended.</p>
<p>B.    <b>Limitations.</b> The following limitations apply:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.   Credits for transportation charges will be applied to the payer's account only, and refunds will be made payable to the payer only.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.   Only one refund or credit is permitted per package. In the case of multiple-piece shipments, this money-back guarantee applies to each package in the shipment. If a service failure occurs for any package within the shipment, a refund or credit will be given only for the portion of the transportation charges applicable to that package. For FedEx International Priority DirectDistribution and FedEx International Priority DirectDistribution Freight, the money-back guarantee is prorated based on the number and weight of packages within the shipment where delivery is not completed by the service commitment.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.  A credit or refund under our money-back guarantee policy will be applied only against charges for the shipment giving rise to the credit.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.  An exact delivery commitment time can be obtained only by telephoning International Customer Service and supplying us with all of the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">1.  Commodity being shipped</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">2.  Date of the shipment</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">3.  Exact destination</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">4.  Weight of the shipment</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">5.  Value of the shipment</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;"><br />
Any transit time published in the FedEx Service Guide or elsewhere, or quoted by Customer Service without the above five required facts, is only an estimate and is not a stated delivery commitment time. You agree that our records regarding quoted delivery times will constitute conclusive proof of any such quotes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.     If a delivery later than the original delivery commitment time is requested by the shipper or recipient before the first delivery attempt is made, the delivery commitment time for application of the money-back guarantee policy will be adjusted to account for the requested delivery date and/or time. However, the money-back guarantee may not apply to certain shipments for which the recipient has requested to modify or customize delivery through methods approved by FedEx.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.     If the shipper or recipient informed FedEx that the recipient location is closed on a certain day or at a certain time, the delivery commitment time for application of the money-back guarantee policy will be the next business day at the delivery commitment time for the service originally selected.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">7.     This money-back guarantee does not apply to requests for invoice adjustment based on overcharges (see the Billing section) or shipments to P.O. box addresses acceptable for delivery (see the Post Office Box Addresses section).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">8.     The money-back guarantee for shipments destined for our extended service areas applies only to the portion of the transportation provided directly by us.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">9.     This money-back guarantee applies only to transportation charges paid by U.S.-based payers and does not apply to duties, taxes or other charges, including ancillary clearance service fees.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">10.  Holidays in international locations will affect our transit times. Contact International Customer Service for information on delivery commitments that may be affected due to the observance of these holidays. Deliveries normally scheduled to be made on the day of holiday observance will be rescheduled for delivery on the next business day. The delivery commitment for application of the money-back guarantee policy will be extended for a period equal to the length of the holiday.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">11.  If the sender or recipient specifies a customs broker other than FedEx or the broker selected by FedEx (where this service is available), notification may be given to the broker by 12 p.m. on the first business day the shipment is available for customs clearance in the destination country, and such notification constitutes timely delivery.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">12.  For FedEx International Next Flight service, the quoted delivery time may be changed for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: flight delays or cancellations due to air traffic control, weather or mechanical problems. If the delivery commitment is changed, the money-back guarantee will only be applicable to the latest quoted delivery time.</p>
<p>C.    <b>Exceptions.</b> FedEx will not be obligated to refund or credit your transportation charges if:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.  We provide you with proof of timely delivery, consisting of the date and time of delivery and, if applicable, the name of the person who signed for the shipment, or service-exception information reflecting that the failure to deliver timely resulted from circumstances described under the Liabilities Not Assumed section.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.  The service failure resulted, in whole or in part, from any of the circumstances described under the Liabilities Not Assumed section.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.  The payer's FedEx account number was not in good credit standing, or payment instructions were invalid, and delivery was delayed until payment arrangements were secured.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.  The shipment was scheduled for delivery on the Wednesday immediately prior to Thanksgiving via any FedEx Express international or FedEx Express Freight international service, and was delivered within 90 minutes of the published delivery commitment time for the selected service and destination.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.  The shipment was scheduled for delivery during the seven calendar days before Christmas Day via any FedEx Express international or FedEx Express Freight international service, and was delivered by the end of the day on the published delivery commitment date for the selected service and destination.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.  The shipment was undeliverable or returned.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">7.   The shipment contained dangerous goods or dry ice.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">8.   The shipment was delayed due to an incorrect address or to the unavailability or refusal of an appropriate or eligible person to accept delivery or sign for the package.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">9.   The shipment was delayed due to customs or regulatory delays, including, but not limited to, any delays resulting from compliance with advance notice or prior notice requirements.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">10.  The delay in delivery was caused by adherence to FedEx policies regarding the payment of duties and taxes prior to customs clearance or at delivery.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">11.  Incorrect FedEx tracking numbers were applied to the subject package or shipment by customers using FedEx electronic shipping devices.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">12.  Complete recipient information was not provided at the time of tender to FedEx. Complete recipient information must be provided on either the air waybill or through any FedEx electronic shipping device.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">13.  You did not book an international freight shipment as required.</p>
<p>D.    <b>Refund or Credit Requests.</b> Refund or Credit Requests. To qualify for a refund or credit due to a service failure, you must notify us of the service failure and request a refund or credit of your transportation charges in compliance with the conditions listed below. If you do not comply with these conditions, you are not entitled to receive a refund or credit and cannot recover compensation for a service failure in any lawsuit.</p>

<p>In addition, Package Consolidators are responsible for complying with all applicable requirements in these terms and conditions including, but not limited to, customs and other legal requirements applicable to packages tendered for international transportation.</p>
<p>If you tender packages to a Package Consolidator instead of to us directly, the following limitations apply:</p>
<p>A.  Package Consolidators are not agents of FedEx, and we are not responsible for any errors or omissions made by them.</p>
<p>B.  Package Consolidators may submit claims for refunds or credits for shipping charges under the money-back guarantee policy. Neither the person or entity tendering the package to the Package Consolidator nor the recipient is eligible for refunds or credits under the money-back guarantee policy.</p>
<p>C.<b>  </b>In order for a Package Consolidator to receive packaging supplies from FedEx, the Package Consolidator must first enter into a Packaging and Pricing Agreement or a FedEx Authorized ShipCenter Agreement with FedEx.</p>
<p>D.  Package Consolidators may charge FedEx Retail Rates for FedEx shipping services, but they are not required to. Package Consolidators set their own rates for reselling FedEx services.</p>
<p>E.  FedEx assumes no liability, other than to the Package Consolidator, for lost, damaged or delayed shipments tendered to a Package Consolidator, as the Package Consolidator is the shipper of these packages. Package Consolidators are independently owned and operated businesses.</p>
<p>F.  See the Package Consolidator representative for information regarding rates and services and the terms and conditions of carriage. Inquiries or claims regarding shipments tendered to a Package Consolidator must also be directed to the Package Consolidator.</p>
<p>G.  As directed by FedEx, Package Consolidators must require a government-issued photo ID to validate the identity of their customer and must keep a record of the name and address on the ID of their customer for each package.<br />

<input id="justifyRteRtl" type="hidden" value="false"/>


<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    You must comply with all applicable laws (including, but not limited to, local, state, federal and international laws), including those governing packing, marking and labeling for all shipments.</p>
<p>B.    It is the responsibility of the sender to properly complete the air waybill. The sender's address on an air waybill or electronic shipping device must show the country in which the shipment is tendered to FedEx.</p>
<p>C.    All packages must be prepared and packed by the shipper for safe transportation with ordinary care in handling in an express-transportation environment. Any articles susceptible to damage as a result of conditions that may be encountered in transportation, such as changes in temperature or atmospheric pressure, must be adequately protected by proper packaging. FedEx assumes no liability for perishables or commodities that could be damaged by exposure to heat or cold. Each shipment must be legibly and durably marked with the name, address and ZIP code/postal code of both the shipper and recipient. Packages cannot be wrapped in kraft paper.</p>
<p>D.    You must use FedEx packaging or new corrugated boxes in good, rigid condition large enough to allow cushioning of contents on the top, bottom and sides. For guidelines on packaging specific commodities go to fedex.com/packaging. Items that cannot be packed into cartons (such as auto tail pipes, mufflers, tires and rims) must have all sharp edges and protrusions wrapped, and the address label must be secured using the tie-on tag or the tire/crate label provided by FedEx (or you may secure it by wrapping pressure-sensitive tape completely around the object). Briefcases, luggage, garment bags, aluminum cases, plastic cases, computer cartons or similar types of items whose outer finish might be damaged by adhesive labels, soiling, marking or other types of surface damage that is normal with ordinary care in handling should be placed in a protective container for shipment. Casters, wheels and rollers must be removed or packaged.</p>
<p>E.    Expanded polystyrene foam coolers must be shipped inside a sturdy outer container unless tested and approved for acceptance by FedEx Packaging Design and Development. Information on how to submit your packaging for testing is available at fedex.com/packaging. Expanded polystyrene foam coolers containing blood, urine and other noninfectious liquid clinical specimens must be shipped inside a sturdy outer packaging.</p>
<p>F.    FedEx does not recommend the use of wet ice (frozen water) as a refrigerant. Packages containing wet ice must be prepared to prevent the leakage of any liquid, regardless of package orientation. For additional wet-ice packaging requirements, refer to the packaging guide Packaging Perishable Shipments at fedex.com/packaging.</p>
<p>G.    If a shipment is refused by the recipient, leaks or is damaged, the shipment will be returned to the sender if possible. If the sender refuses to accept the returned shipment or it cannot be returned because of leakage, or damage due to faulty packaging, the shipper is responsible for and will reimburse FedEx for all costs and fees of any type connected with the legal disposal of the shipment, and all costs and fees of any type connected with cleanup of any spill or leakage.</p>
<p>H.    FedEx reserves the right to request a shipper to submit a representative sampling of the packaging for inspection and testing. If the shipper fails to comply with our request to inspect and test the packaging, or the sampling fails FedEx testing, FedEx will not be liable for any damages due to improper packaging.</p>
<p>I.      FedEx may issue written notice to you if you repeatedly fail to adhere to FedEx's packaging requirements due to your pattern or practice of insufficient packaging. Claims for damage or loss associated with an identified pattern or practice of insufficient packaging will be denied. Any such claim filed related to your shipments will not be paid, regardless of which party files the claim, unless the claimant can establish that the loss or damage did not result from a failure to use proper packaging. FedEx will continue to deny such claims until we determine that you have ceased the pattern or practice of failing to adhere to the packaging requirements. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to limit FedEx's right to deny a claim where the shipment in dispute is found to have improper packaging.</p>
<p>J.     Information on how to submit your packaging for testing or evaluation, and tips on packaging specific commodities (including automotive and mechanical parts, computers and perishables), are available at fedex.com/packaging.</p>
<p>K.    For international freight shipments, freight must be on a skid, pallet or other forkliftable base. Boxes should be stacked squarely on the skid without hanging over the edge, and the weight should be distributed evenly on the skid to avoid excess weight being placed on materials inside the cartons. Use 70-gauge stretchwrap and pass a minimum of two bands (tightly secured) through the skid voids and around all cartons.</p>
<p>L.    FedEx account holders may order supplies via fedex.com or by calling <b><a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a></b> (say &quot;order shipping supplies&quot;).<br />

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    We provide delivery service at no additional charge to international destinations within primary service areas.</p>
<p>B.    Agents are utilized for deliveries to points in extended service areas (ESAs). Depending on the final destination, an ESA surcharge per shipment may be applied for U.S. export shipments; see Rates in the FedEx Service Guide for details. Please call FedEx International Customer Service to determine if your shipment will be subject to an ESA surcharge.</p>
<p>C.    We do not offer a restricted-delivery service and may deliver to someone other than the person or entity named as the recipient. We also may make an indirect delivery. Indirect delivery is a completed delivery to an address or location other than the address on the air waybill. Package addresses must include the complete street address and telephone or telex number of the recipient.</p>
<p>D.    Shipments to hotels, hospitals, government offices or installations, university campuses, or other facilities that utilize a mailroom or other central receiving area will be delivered to the central receiving area, unless otherwise authorized and approved by FedEx.</p>
<p>E.    Any person scheduling a pickup other than the sender must provide a FedEx account number in good credit standing, otherwise the pickup must be scheduled by the sender. We require a minimum of two hours from the time the  shipment(s) will be ready to make the pickup. (Contact FedEx International Customer Service for the specific lead times required.) Repeated pickup attempts without packages being ready may result in the cancellation of pickup privileges.</p>
<p>F.    If we inadvertently accept a shipment with a destination city not served in a country to which FedEx International Priority is provided, we may attempt to complete the delivery. However, certain limitations will apply. (See the Liabilities Not Assumed section.)</p>
<p>G.    FedEx International Priority Freight or FedEx International Economy Freight shipments picked up or delivered to H3 areas will be picked up or delivered via cartage agents and a special handling fee will apply; see Rates in the FedEx Service Guide. Freight pickup and delivery is not available on weekends (except in offshore locations where standard business days vary) for FedEx International Priority Freight and FedEx International Economy Freight.</p>
<p>H.    Proof of pickup is available upon request. You must provide the pickup number or FedEx tracking number (also known as the air waybill number). We will not provide proof of pickup unless you provide this information.</p>
<p>I.      At our sole discretion, we may refuse to pick up or deliver a shipment (package or freight), or use alternative pickup or delivery arrangements, to maintain the safety of our employees and in cases in which we believe that our services may be used in violation of local, state, federal or international laws.</p>
<p>J.     Additional charges may apply for late-hours, weekend or holiday pickup and delivery.</p>
<p>K.    The delivery commitment for FedEx International Next Flight service will be the delivery time quoted to each customer. The quoted delivery time will vary for each shipment and will depend on the availability of suitable commercial airline flights.<br />
<br />
A quoted delivery time may be changed for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, flight delays or cancellations due to air traffic control, weather or mechanical problems. In the event of the occurrence of any of the foregoing, the FedEx International Next Flight Service Desk shall quote a new delivery time to the shipper and recipient (if requested by the shipper) by telephone or by customer-reasonably-requested method; this new delivery time shall then become the quoted delivery time. Two attempts will be made to reach the shipper and two attempts to reach the recipient (if requested by the shipper). Any such change in the quoted delivery time will be logged in to the tracking system.</p>
<p>L.     In order to facilitate delivery or release of a shipment, FedEx may, at its sole discretion, contact the recipient to obtain delivery instructions, or to notify them that a delivery is scheduled, that a delivery has been completed or that a shipment is available for pickup at a Hold at Location facility. Where available, FedEx may also permit recipients to request modification or customization of delivery through methods approved by FedEx.</p>
<p>M.   At its discretion, FedEx may not deliver or attempt delivery within the delivery commitment time of the service requested, if the shipper or recipient requested a later delivery or informed FedEx that the recipient is closed during the delivery commitment time. In this situation, charges will be assessed based on the service initially selected by the shipper. The shipper or payer is responsible for communicating with the recipient regarding requested later delivery times and is responsible for knowing the days and times that the recipient location can accept FedEx deliveries.</p>
<p>N.    If a shipper tenders packages that substantially exceed the number, type, size and/or weight of packages tendered on average for the location by the shipper throughout the year, FedEx may accept such packages but, at its sole discretion, suspend the FedEx Money-Back Guarantee, if applicable, or adjust commitment times.</p>
<p>O.    We reserve the right to assess a Residential Delivery surcharge on any shipment delivered to a home or private residence, including locations where a business is operated from a home, or on any shipment in which the shipper has designated the delivery address as a residence, including shipments where the delivery location has been designated as a Residential Delivery in error.<br />

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>An undeliverable shipment is one that cannot be delivered for reasons that include, but are not limited to, any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The recipient refuses to pay for a bill-recipient shipment.</li>
<li>The recipient refuses to accept the shipment prior to, during or after delivery.</li>
<li>The recipient's delivery address cannot be located.</li>
<li>The shipment was addressed to an area not served by FedEx.</li>
<li>The shipment's contents or packaging are damaged to the point that rewrapping is not possible.</li>
<li>The shipment is unable to clear customs.</li>
<li>The shipment would likely cause damage or delay to other shipments or property or injury to personnel.</li>
<li>The shipment contains prohibited items.</li>
<li>The recipient's place of business is closed.</li>
<li>No appropriate person was available to accept the shipment at a delivery location on the initial delivery attempt or reattempts.</li>
<li>The shipment was improperly packaged.</li>
<li>The recipient of a Hold at Location shipment cannot be located.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should a shipment be classified as undeliverable or unidentifiable, the following guidelines apply:</p>
<p>A.  If a shipment is undeliverable for any reason, we may attempt to notify the sender to arrange for the return of the shipment if local customs regulations will allow. If the sender cannot be contacted within five business days, we may place the shipment in a general order warehouse or a customs-bonded warehouse or will dispose of the shipment. FedEx reserves the right, at its sole discretion, and without notice, to sell, destroy or otherwise dispose of undeliverable shipments. By tendering a shipment, the shipper agrees to transfer and convey good and sufficient title of the contents of undeliverable shipments to FedEx, and agrees to pay any costs incurred in returning, storing or in the sale, destruction or disposal thereof.  </p>
<p>B.  For shipments returned from international points to the U.S., return charges and fees will be assessed to the original shipper, along with the original charges and fees. Also included will be any other charges incurred by us, including, but not limited to, duties, taxes, ancillary clearance fees and storage fees, if applicable. For returned shipments containing dangerous goods, the shipper must supply a completed return air waybill and all other required documents.</p>
<p>C.  Shipments that cannot be returned due to local regulatory constraints will either be placed in a general order warehouse or a customs-bonded warehouse or disposed of at our sole discretion and at any location. The shipper agrees to pay any costs incurred by FedEx in such placement or disposal.</p>

The contract of carriage as expressed in this tariff constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all previous agreements and understandings, whether oral or written, between the parties or any agents, affiliates or subcontractors thereof (including FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. and its agents, affiliates and employees [&quot;FedEx Office&quot;]) with respect to the subject matter hereof, and each party warrants that it has not relied and will not be relying upon any evaluation, representation or advice from the other party, its agents, affiliates or subcontractors (including any agents, affiliates or employees of FedEx Office) except representations expressly made in writing in this tariff. <br />
 <br />
 FedEx reserves the right to unilaterally modify, amend or supplement the rates, features of service, services, terms and conditions, and tariff in the FedEx Service Guide applicable to all customers without notice. All modifications, amendments or supplements may be authorized only by an officer in the Legal Department of FedEx Corporation or successor positions, but no other agent or employee of FedEx nor any other agent or party is authorized to do so.<br />
 <br />
 The FedEx Service Guide consists of the service information at fedex.com/serviceguide and the overview of services in the downloadable FedEx Service Guide (U.S. and U.S. export); U.S., U.S. export , U.S. import and U.S. retail rates; the FedEx Express Terms and Conditions; this FedEx Ground Tariff; and the FedEx SameDay City Tariff. The service information at fedex.com/serviceguide (excluding rates, the FedEx Express Terms and Conditions, the FedEx Ground Tariff, and the FedEx SameDay City Tariff) and the overview of services in the downloadable FedEx Service Guide are not part of the contract of carriage. To the extent that conflicts exist, if any, between the terms and conditions, other parts of the FedEx Service Guide, and the current versions, if any, of the FedEx Ground Tariff 200 and fedex.com, the downloadable version (PDF) of the FedEx Ground Tariff (including any amendments, supplements or both) as then in effect on the date of shipment shall control.<br />
 <br />
 <i>Note:</i> Unless otherwise specified in this tariff, the rules listed in this tariff apply to packages originating in the U.S. for transportation via a FedEx Ground service, except that this tariff does not apply to packages tendered to FedEx Ground for shipment via the FedEx SmartPost service.<br />

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>All shipments originating in the U.S. and paid for with cash, check, debit or credit card must be tendered at a staffed shipping location, and will be charged FedEx Retail Rates.</p>
<p>Account numbers are issued by FedEx according to shipping location and are nontransferable. Account numbers are issued and used solely at the discretion of FedEx. FedEx may discontinue the use of accounts, in whole or in part, and terminate all or particular accounts and account numbers at any time, for any reason, at its sole discretion. Improper, illegal or any other misuse of your FedEx account may also, at the sole discretion of FedEx, result in loss of discounts or termination of the account. Improper, illegal or other misuse includes, but is not limited to, unauthorized consolidation of shipments owned by different parties, or violations of the terms and conditions in this FedEx Service Guide. If your account has been compromised or stolen, the account may be closed and you may be issued a new account. However, you will be responsible for all valid charges on the closed account. Any materials, rights or privileges that you acquire by holding a FedEx account number may not be used for any purpose other than shipping with FedEx, and FedEx may seek damages against you for any improper, illegal or other misuse of your account. If your account is terminated, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to deny your application for new or additional FedEx account numbers at any time in the future. All charges will be billed and must be remitted in U.S. funds.</p>
<p>Any individual or entity that uses the FedEx account or shipping discounts of another FedEx account holder without authorization will be charged Standard List Rates for all such shipments without prior notice. This includes all shipments, whether they are classified as “Bill Sender,” “Bill Recipient” or “Bill Third Party,” or any other method of billing. Unauthorized use includes, but is not limited to, using the shipping discount of another FedEx account holder without the knowledge and permission of both FedEx and the account holder.</p>
<p>All requests for account numbers are subject to credit investigation and verification by our Credit Department and Customer Account Confirmation Department. FedEx utilizes business credit reporting agencies, audited financial statements, Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's bond ratings, and other sources as necessary, to determine eligibility for open credit terms. FedEx does not offer consumer credit privileges. Any individual shipping for personal use must prepay the shipment charges or establish a FedEx account for billing directly to a major credit card. Stored-value cards or gift cards cannot be used to open an account; however, such cards may be used for payment when tendering a package at staffed FedEx shipping locations, and in conjunction with our credit card acceptance policy. If your FedEx account is billed directly to a credit card, you agree to the following terms: (1) you authorize FedEx to initiate variable charges to the credit card to settle charges payable to FedEx; (2) you authorize FedEx to charge your card for any unpaid amounts on your account; (3) you authorize the card issuer to pay any amounts associated with your account without requiring a signed receipt; (4) you agree to keep your card information current (FedEx may receive updates on your card information from participating issuing banks and may update your account profile to avoid service disruptions); (5) you agree that FedEx shall have no liability for any insufficient funds or other charges incurred from attempts to charge and/or place holds on your card; and (6) your agreement to these terms and conditions is to be accepted as authorization to the card issuer to pay all amounts associated with your account.<br />
</p>
<p>The party to whom a FedEx account number is issued is liable for all charges to the account, including those resulting from unauthorized use. The account holder is responsible for the safekeeping of the account number. The account number should be released only to those authorized to ship on the account.</p>
<p>Failure to keep your FedEx account current may result in &quot;termination&quot; of your FedEx Ground service. If the account number to be billed is not valid, the shipment may be refused, delayed or returned until an alternative form of payment is secured. If a package is held, returned, or delivery is otherwise delayed because the account is not in good credit standing, you will not be entitled to a refund or credit of your transportation charges under the money-back guarantee policy.</p>
<p>You must use your FedEx account number to obtain any discount applicable to your account. Use of your account number constitutes your agreement that all packages shipped by us shall be subject to this tariff, as modified, amended or supplemented.</p>
<p>For FedEx Ground services, you may only request FedEx to bill accounts with a U.S. or Canadian billing address. Any request for FedEx to bill otherwise is null and void, and FedEx, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to bill the sender for those charges and assess an invalid account surcharge.</p>
<p>FedEx may provide trade credit information on its account holders to credit bureaus.<br />

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    <b>&quot;Bill Sender&quot;</b> means charges will be billed to the sender. Payment on the account must be current. The sender may request an initial rebilling to another party, but all subsequent rebills will be only to the sender.</p>
<p>B.    <b>&quot;Bill Recipient's FedEx Account Number&quot;</b> means charges will be billed to the recipient (except for certain additional charges that are billed to the sender, including, but not limited to, weekly pickup fees, alternate address pickup fees, on-call per-package pickup charges, address correction fees, and invalid or missing account number fees). &quot;Bill Recipient&quot; should not be confused with C.O.D. service. In order to choose this billing option, the recipient's FedEx account number must be inputted into the sender's electronic shipping system at the time the package is processed and payment on the account must be current. If the recipient is billed initially and refuses to make payment for the shipment, the charges may be rebilled to a third party. If not paid by the third party, any additional rebilling will be to the sender's account. (See section N, Billing Special Handling Fees.) The sender is liable for, and will be billed for, all charges and fees, plus all special handling fees in the event recipient or any third party does not pay. If due to the charges the recipient account exceeds credit limits with FedEx Ground, the sender will automatically be billed.</p>
<p>C.   <b>&quot;Bill Third Party's FedEx Account Number&quot;</b> means charges will be billed to someone other than the sender or recipient (except for certain additional charges that are billed to the sender, including, but not limited to, weekly pickup fees, alternate address pickup fees, on-call per-package pickup charges, address correction fees, invalid or missing account number fees, and fees associated with C.O.D. or electronic C.O.D. [E.C.O.D.]). In order to choose this billing option, the FedEx account number of the third party must be inputted into the sender's electronic shipping system at the time the package is processed and payment on the account must be current. If the third party is billed initially and refuses to make payment for the shipment, the charges may be rebilled to another party, but subsequent requests will only be rebilled to the sender. (See section N, Billing Special Handling Fees.) If the party that is rebilled refuses to pay, the sender is liable for and will be billed for all charges and fees, plus all special handling fees. If due to the charges the third-party account exceeds credit limits with FedEx Ground, the sender will automatically be billed.</p>
<p>D.   <b>&quot;Bill FedEx Ground COLLECT&quot;</b> means transportation charges will be billed to the recipient and certain additional charges will be billed to the sender. The transportation charges billed to the recipient include, but are not limited to, fuel surcharges and out-of-area surcharges. The certain additional charges billed to the sender include, but are not limited to, weekly pickup fees, alternate address pickup fees, on-call per-package pickup charges and address correction fees. In order to choose &quot;Bill FedEx Ground COLLECT,&quot; the sender is responsible for shipping to consignees who are authorized COLLECT recipients. If the consignee is not authorized, the sender is liable for, and will be billed for, all charges and fees, plus all special handling fees in the event the recipient or any third party does not pay. If not paid by the third party, any additional rebilling will be to the sender's account (see section N, Billing Special Handling Fees). &quot;Bill FedEx Ground COLLECT&quot; should not be confused with C.O.D. service.<br />
<br />
When shipping packages using the FedEx Ground COLLECT service option, the sender agrees to pay all additional charges and surcharges related to the shipment other than those billed to the recipient, as described above. The sender agrees to ship packages collect only to recipients authorized by FedEx Ground to receive collect shipments. The sender further agrees to pay all applicable transportation charges if a package is shipped to an unauthorized recipient or if an authorized recipient refuses to accept delivery of a collect shipment. An additional charge will be assessed on any package that is shipped collect to a recipient not authorized by FedEx Ground to receive collect packages.</p>
<p>E.    For <b>&quot;Bill Recipient&quot;</b> <b>&quot;Bill Third Party&quot;</b> or <b>&quot;Bill FedEx Ground COLLECT&quot;</b> transactions, if the recipient or third party refuses to pay the charges, refuses delivery or cannot be contacted, the sender is responsible and will be billed for any and all charges. For &quot;Bill Recipient,&quot; &quot;Bill Third Party&quot; or &quot;Bill FedEx Ground COLLECT&quot; transactions, FedEx Ground may verify the method of payment and reserves the right to not accept any &quot;Bill Recipient,&quot; &quot;Bill Third Party&quot; or &quot;Bill FedEx Ground COLLECT&quot; shipment for which such verification cannot be established.</p>
<p>F.    FedEx may consider payment type in determining pricing and discounts, and reserves the right to adjust discounts based on payment type.</p>
<p>G.   The sender's shipment may be delayed if FedEx Ground determines that it is billed to a FedEx account number that is not in good credit standing. The service failure money-back guarantee will not apply (see the Money-Back Guarantee Policy section for details and limitations).</p>
<p>H.   C.O.D. shipments may not be shipped &quot;Collect&quot; or &quot;Bill Recipient.&quot; Shipping charges for C.O.D. shipments must be billed to either a sender's or third party's FedEx account number; they may not be paid by cash, check or credit card.</p>
<p>I.      NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE GIVEN TO FEDEX GROUND, THE SENDER IS ULTIMATELY LIABLE FOR ALL CHARGES AND FEES. For FedEx returns shipments, please see Return Options.</p>
<p>J.     A special handling fee will be applied for any check or electronic funds transfer (EFT) that is dishonored due to insufficient funds on deposit or incorrect or insufficient signature of the drawer.</p>
<p>K.    Your payment must be accompanied by the remittance data that supports the payment. Remittance data must include the FedEx invoice number and the associated amount(s) being paid on the FedEx invoice. Payment at the tracking-number level must be transmitted to FedEx via electronic data interchange (EDI) — see the EDI section below. </p>

<p>M.   If you are interested in or have questions regarding any of our invoicing or payment methods, contact your FedEx account executive or call FedEx Revenue Services at <b><a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a></b> (say &quot;billing&quot;), or access our internet application Manage My Account at fedex.com.</p>
<p>N.   <b>Billing Special Handling Fees.</b> A special handling fee will be applied in the following situations:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     Invoicing where an incomplete, inaccurate, invalid or deleted account number appears in the EDI transmission of shipping information.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">a.     For &quot;Bill Sender&quot; transactions, if the account number on the shipping bar code is incomplete, inaccurate, invalid or deleted, and FedEx Ground is able to determine the correct number from FedEx Ground records, all charges and fees, plus the special handling fee, will be billed to the sender, and any appropriate earned discount will apply. If the correct account number cannot be determined from FedEx Ground records, all charges and fees plus the special handling fee will be billed to the sender, and no discount will be allowed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">b.     For &quot;Bill Third Party&quot; or &quot;Bill Recipient&quot; transactions, if the third party or recipient account number in the electronic data interchange (EDI) transmission is incomplete, inaccurate, invalid or deleted, all charges and fees, plus the special handling fee, will be billed to the sender. If FedEx Ground can determine the sender's correct account number from FedEx Ground records, it will be used for billing, and any appropriate earned discount will apply. If billed to sender and sender's correct account number cannot be determined from FedEx Ground records, no discount will be allowed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">c.     The fee for an incomplete, inaccurate, invalid or deleted account number will be applied only once for each package with such an account number.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     Payer Rebilling. A special handling fee will be charged to the sender for all requests to change a billing from the party billed or the bill-to party shown on the shipping transmission. If there are multiple requests, the fee may be applied for each invoice line item, which is rebilled. Requests for rebilling will be accepted up to 180 days from the invoice date, not counting the invoice date. <br />
<br />
Requests for rebilling of transportation charges must be received via one of the approved channels:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">a.     Submit your request through the Non-Pay option with Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) if you are a registered user; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">b.     Use our internet application FedEx Billing Online at fedex.com if you are a registered user; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">c.     Submit your request via fedex.com/us/customersupport/email/express_ground.html (select Billing/Invoicing as the category). Your request for a rebill of transportation charges must include the current invoice number, the FedEx tracking number, amount and the new FedEx account number that you want to rebill; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">d.     Submit the request via our automated interactive voice response system at <b><a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a></b> (say &quot;billing&quot;). Your request for a rebill of transportation charges must include your FedEx account number, if any, the current invoice number, the FedEx tracking number and the new FedEx account number that you want to rebill.</p>
<p>O.   <b>Invoice Adjustments/Overcharges:</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     FedEx Ground reserves the right to audit shipments to verify service selection, shipment weight and dimensions. Package shape and dimensions may change during transit, which can affect the package’s dimensional weight and surcharge eligibility. If the service selected, weight entered or dimensions entered are incorrect or change during transit, FedEx Ground may make appropriate adjustments to the shipment charges at any time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     Default Billing. Senders are responsible for entry of accurate shipment information in any electronic shipping device. Because the number of packages and weight per package are critical to our ability to correctly invoice, any omission or incorrect entry or unavailable information will result in a billing based on our estimate of the number of packages transported and either the standard dimensional factor at the time of billing or a standard &quot;default&quot; weight-per-package estimate determined at our sole discretion.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     You may request an invoice adjustment for reasons not related to a service failure in the following ways:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">a.     Use our internet application FedEx Billing Online at fedex.com if you are a registered user; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">b.     Submit your request through the invoice adjustment feature at fedex.com; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">c.     Submit the request via fedex.com/us/customersupport/email/express_ground.html (select Billing/Invoicing as the category). All adjustment requests must state the reason an adjustment or refund is warranted and must provide the following: the FedEx account number (if any); the FedEx tracking number; and the date of shipment; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">d.     Submit the request via our telephone invoice adjustment system at  <b><a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a> </b>(say &quot;billing&quot;). If you choose to submit your request via the telephone invoice adjustment system, the request must state the reason an adjustment or refund is warranted and must provide the following: the FedEx account number (if any); the FedEx tracking number; and the date of shipment; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">e.     If you choose to send the invoice adjustment request separately from the remittance statement, please send to:<br />
FedEx<br />
Revenue Services<br />
3965 Airways Boulevard<br />
Module G<br />
Memphis, TN 38116</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">A partial payment against an invoice is not considered a request for invoice adjustment or notice of a refund request.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     Requests for invoice adjustment due to an overcharge must be received within 180 days after the date of shipment. For adjustments due to a service failure, see the Money-Back Guarantee Policy section.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">For additional information or assistance regarding billing issues, please contact a FedEx account executive.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.     FedEx is not obligated to refund any overcharge or pay any other obligation owed when your FedEx account is, or has been in the past, more than 60 days past due.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.     If your account is more than 60 days past due, FedEx may, at its sole discretion, apply any overcharge amounts or other overpayments it agrees are owed to you against the oldest invoices.</p>
<p>P.    <b>Additional Taxes.</b> If a federal value-added, consumption or similar tax is applicable to your shipment, FedEx Ground reserves the right to add that amount to your shipment charges.</p>
<p>Q.   The sender is responsible for all reasonable costs incurred by FedEx Ground in attempting to obtain payment on any transaction. Such costs include, but are not limited to, attorneys' fees, collection agency fees, and interest and court costs.</p>
<p>R.   At our sole discretion, FedEx may transfer and assign ownership of, and any rights to collect, any and all charges due and payable to us.</p>
<p>S.    <b>Missing or Invalid Account Number.</b> An account number is invalid if it is not the correct account number for the bill-to party, or it is the account number for a recipient or third party who fails to pay the shipping charges. An additional charge will be assessed for each missing or invalid account number.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    <b>Filing of Claims:</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     All claims in connection with request for FedEx Ground C.O.D. service and all claims for loss of or damage to property tendered to FedEx Ground for transportation in interstate or intrastate commerce (U.S.) must be filed in writing; must include or refer to the Customer Shipping Record, if applicable, tracking ID, and date or other facts sufficient to identify the package involved; and must be accompanied by documents that prove the value of the property and/or extent of the loss or damage.<br />
<br />
<b>Documentation Requirements.</b> Documentation Requirements. Such documents may include original purchase invoices, estimates or invoices for repair (repairs are not authorized under this provision and should not be made until FedEx Ground has inspected the damaged package or expressly waived its right to inspect the damaged package), expense statements, appraisal, final confirmation screen if online order with proof of purchase, or other certified documents; must assert our liability for the alleged loss or damage; and must make claim for the payment of a specified or determinable amount of money. A request for proof of delivery does not constitute the filing of a claim.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Notification.</i></b><i> In the case of a claim for concealed loss or damage that is not discovered at the time of delivery, the sender or recipient must notify FedEx Ground as promptly as possible after the discovery of the damage, and in any event no later than 60 days after the date of delivery. Notification should be made by calling <a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a> (say &quot;claims&quot;) and the claimant shall be issued a Damaged Call Tag. At the time the Damaged Call Tag is issued, the call center agent will provide a confirmation number. This number should be recorded on the claim form along with the original tracking ID where indicated. Notification does not constitute filing of a claim as required in section C below.</i><br />
<br />
Except as provided in the paragraph above, receipt of the shipment by the recipient without written notice of damage on the delivery record is prima facie evidence that the shipment was delivered in good condition. As a condition to FedEx Ground considering a claim, all the original shipping cartons, packing (inner and outer) and contents must be made available for FedEx Ground inspections. See the Damaged Property section below for additional details. Package and contents must be retained by the claimant until the claim is resolved.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     You can file a claim in the following ways:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">a.     Submit claims online at fedex.com/us/claimsonline (excluding FedEx Ground C.O.D. claims) for U.S. shipments, U.S. export shipments to Canada and U.S.-inbound shipments from Canada.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">b.     Send written claims, including the completed claim form and supporting documentation, via the U.S. Postal Service or fax to:<br />
<br />
FedEx Cargo Claims Department<br />
P.O. Box 256<br />
Pittsburgh, PA 15230<br />
Fax: <b>1.877.229.4766</b><br />
<br />
If you fax your completed claim form and supporting documentation, FedEx will send you a confirmation letter by return fax.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">c.     Call customer service at <b><a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a></b> (say &quot;claims&quot;) to obtain a case number for your claim, then complete a print copy of the claim form. You may have to submit supporting documentation using FedEx Claims Online or the mailing address or fax number listed above.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     FedEx Ground will not voluntarily pay a claim for an uncertain amount, such as &quot;$100 more or less.&quot; FedEx Ground is not obligated to act on any claim until all transportation charges are paid. The claim amount may not be deducted from these charges or any outstanding balance.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     Bad order reports, appraisal reports of damage, notations of exceptions on delivery records or other documents, inspection reports issued by FedEx Ground inspectors or inspection agencies, requests for proof of delivery, and tracer or inspection requests standing alone are not sufficient to comply with these claim filing requirements.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.     FedEx Ground shipment-status information is not intended or permitted to be used by the shipper to file claims. (See Shipment-Status Information in the Proof of Delivery section.)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.     FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THE ABOVE CONDITIONS WILL RESULT IN THE DENIAL OF A CLAIM.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">7.     FedEx Ground reserves the option to pick up salvage on damaged claims when the claim is paid in full.</p>
<p>B.    <b>Acknowledgment of Claims.</b> FedEx Ground will, upon receipt in writing of a proper claim filed in the manner and form described in these regulations and accompanied by the documents described, acknowledge the receipt of such claim in writing within 30 days after the date of receipt by FedEx Ground unless FedEx Ground shall have paid or declined such claim in writing within 30 days of the receipt thereof. FedEx Ground will create either in writing or electronically a separate file for each claim received, assign each claim a successive claim file number, and note the claim number assigned on all documents filed in support of the claim and all records and correspondence relating to the claim, including the written acknowledgment of receipt and, if in its possession, the pickup and delivery records covering the package involved. FedEx Ground will record the date a claim is received on the face of the claim document. The date of receipt will also be noted on our written acknowledgment of receipt.</p>
<p>C.   <b>Time Limit for Filing Claims.</b> Claims in connection with requests for FedEx Ground C.O.D. service and claims for loss, damage or delay must be filed in writing with FedEx Ground within nine months from the date of delivery, or, in the event that FedEx Ground failed to make delivery, within nine months after the package was tendered to FedEx Ground for shipment. Suits against FedEx Ground must be instituted within two years and one day from the date FedEx Ground gives written notice that FedEx Ground has disallowed any part of the claim specified in the notice. If claims are not filed or suits are not instituted in accordance with the foregoing provisions, FedEx Ground will not be liable and such claims will not be paid. A Claim Reporting Form can be requested from a FedEx account representative or by calling <b><a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a></b> (say &quot;claims&quot;).</p>
<p>D.   <b>Investigation of Claims:</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     Each claim must be supported by the original Customer Shipping Record (if applicable), evidence that applicable transportation charges have been paid, and documents that prove the value of the property, and/or extent of the loss or damage. Such documents may include original purchase invoices, estimates or invoices for repair, expense statements, appraisals, or other certified documents. The documents must be verifiable to our satisfaction. Where the property involved in a claim has not been invoiced to the recipient, or where an invoice does not show price or value, or where the property involved has not been sold, or where the property has been transferred at bookkeeping values only, FedEx Ground will, before voluntarily paying a claim thereon, require the claimant to establish the destination value of the quantity shipped, transported or involved, and to certify the correctness of the valuations in writing.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     When a claim for loss of an entire package or an entire shipment cannot otherwise be authenticated upon investigation, FedEx Ground will obtain from the recipient of the shipment involved a certified statement in writing that the property for which the claim is filed has not been received from any other source.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     In the event that the shipper and the recipient have refused a package, the property shall thereupon pass to FedEx Ground. FedEx Ground will not honor a claim for an abandoned package.</p>
<p>E.    <b>Disposition of Claims.</b> FedEx Ground will, after receiving a written claim for loss or damage to the property transported, either pay actual or declared value for the property, whichever is lower; or decline, or make a firm compromise settlement offer in writing to the sender (unless special arrangements have been made) within 120 days after receipt of claim by FedEx Ground. If a claim cannot be processed and disposed of within 120 days after the receipt thereof, FedEx Ground will advise in writing of the status of the claim and the reason for the delay in making final disposition. Acceptance of payment of a claim shall extinguish any right to recover in connection with that shipment.</p>
<p>F.    <b>Damaged Property:</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     FedEx Ground Discovered Damage. Whenever property is damaged by FedEx Ground in the course of transportation and discovered by FedEx Ground prior to delivery, FedEx Ground will either (1) return the damaged property to the shipper or (2) remove any damaged property and ship the balance of undamaged merchandise. If determined to be liable and if damaged property is returned to the shipper, FedEx Ground may, at the shipper's request, pay the full actual or declared value of the property, whichever is lower, and title of the property shall thereupon pass to FedEx Ground. If the shipper makes such a request, the shipper must hold the damaged property until FedEx Ground has completed the processing of the shipper's claim. FedEx Ground shall not be liable for any special, incidental or consequential damages.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     Concealed Loss or Damage. Whenever property is delivered by FedEx Ground and damage or loss is subsequently discovered by the recipient, inspection may be made by FedEx Ground as promptly as practicable after receipt of request from the recipient or shipper. The shipper or recipient must notify FedEx Ground as promptly as possible after discovery of the damage, and in any event no later than 60 days after the date of delivery. FedEx Ground reserves the right to inspect a damaged shipment on customer premises as well as the right to retrieve the damaged shipment for inspection at a local FedEx facility. All of the original shipping cartons, packing and contents must be available for our inspection and retained until the claim is concluded. Inspection will include examination of the damaged property, the shipping container and its packing, and any other action necessary to establish all the facts. If a shortage is involved, the inspector will compare the contents of package with the invoice, weigh the shipping container and contents, or conduct any other type of investigation necessary to establish that a loss has occurred. In either case, the inspection will be limited to a factual report. The shipper and recipient must cooperate with FedEx Ground to assist in the inspection. A written record of our findings will be made and a copy given to the shipper for claim support upon request. Any inspection report issued will be incorporated into the claim file. FedEx reserves the right to request a self-inspection requiring proof of damage in the form of photographs of the carton, inner packaging and damaged contents. If requested, this documentation must be delivered to us within nine months after the package was tendered to FedEx Ground for shipment.<br />
<br />
The terms and conditions of the FedEx Ground Tariff applicable to the original shipment (including, but not limited to, any declared value or limitation of liability) will govern the disposition of all claims in connection with said shipment, including any claim relative to the retrieval, inspection, call tag or return of said shipment.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     In the event FedEx Ground does not make an inspection, the recipient must make the inspection and record all information pertinent to the cause. The recipient's inspection, in such case, may be considered as the FedEx Ground inspection and will not jeopardize any recovery due the shipper based on the facts contained in the report.</p>
<p>G.   <b>Spotted Trailers.</b> The shipper agrees to load any trailers spotted at its facilities within 48 hours after being spotted with 225 or more packages per trailer. The shipper agrees not to file claims on any package shortages for spotted trailers. Upon written request from the shipper, FedEx Ground agrees to notify the shipper of any package shortages within 120 hours after the shipper's packages are transmitted to FedEx Ground. Notification to the shipper shall include date of pickup and the number of packages short of the total provided by the shipper on a computer-generated manifest. The shipper agrees not to file claims in connection with any package shortages reported by FedEx Ground to the shipper.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    <b>FedEx Ground C.O.D. Service:</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     FedEx Ground offers collect-on-delivery service for packages within the U.S. and from the U.S. to Canada (E.C.O.D. remittance is only available for packages within the U.S.). To request FedEx Ground C.O.D. service, the shipper must prepare and attach to each C.O.D. package a C.O.D. label showing the amount to be collected and a C.O.D. barcode label to designate the type of collection. THE C.O.D. AMOUNT IS NOT THE SAME AS, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH, DECLARED VALUE. If the shipper does not also declare the value of the package, our liability for loss or damage shall be limited to the loss or damage actually sustained by the shipper or $100, whichever is lower (see the Declared Value and Limits of Liability section for details).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     FedEx Ground will collect for each C.O.D. package the amount shown on the C.O.D. label attached to the package, not to exceed $25,000 per package. If collection cannot be made, FedEx Ground will return the C.O.D. package to the shipper. The shipper must attach a C.O.D. barcode label to each C.O.D. package to designate the type of collection:<br />
<br />
A &quot;Regular&quot; C.O.D. barcode label is used when the shipper does not designate the type of payment to be collected. FedEx Ground will accept money orders or checks (including cashier’s checks, official checks, certified checks, company checks and personal checks) as payment. Cash is not an acceptable form of payment if the “Regular” C.O.D. barcode label is used. <br />
<br />
A &quot;Guaranteed Funds&quot; C.O.D. barcode label is used when the shipper designates a money order, cashier's check, official check or certified check to be collected.<br />
<br />
A &quot;Currency&quot; C.O.D. barcode label is used when the shipper designates only currency to be collected. FedEx Ground will not accept currency in excess of $750 in payment for the C.O.D. amount associated with any one package delivered in the U.S. Additional per-package charges for &quot;Currency&quot; C.O.D.-labeled packages delivered in the U.S. will apply. The additional per-package charges for &quot;Currency&quot; C.O.D.-labeled packages do not apply to shipments from the U.S. to Canada.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     The original transportation of packages, collection of the payment and delivery of the payment instrument or remittance of the payment are considered a single shipment and the terms and conditions in the Declared Value and Limits of Liability section are applicable to the entirety of a C.O.D. shipment.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     Our liability for loss, damage, delay, misdelivery, misinformation, nondelivery, failure to collect the C.O.D. amount, failure to collect the specified form of payment, collection of an instrument in the wrong amount, or failure or delay in delivering the payment instrument is limited to the declared value, subject in every event to the maximum declared-value limits and other limitations referenced above and in the Declared Value and Limits of Liability section.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.     All checks (including cashier's checks, official checks and certified checks) and money orders tendered in payment of C.O.D. packages will be accepted by FedEx Ground at the shipper's risk, including, but not limited to, the risk of nonpayment and forgery, and FedEx Ground shall not be liable upon any such instrument.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.     An additional charge will be assessed for each request for C.O.D. service to be performed, whether or not FedEx Ground is able to collect as requested. If the recipient cannot be located or fails or refuses to pay the C.O.D. amount via the requested instrument, the shipment will be returned to the shipper, and no refund or credit of either the transportation charges or the C.O.D. charges will be given.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">7.     Shipper represents and warrants it has legal right, interest, or appropriate legal title, to the C.O.D. funds subject to be collected and is authorized by the appropriate parties to receive such funds.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">8.     Performance of the C.O.D. service will not constitute FedEx Ground as the shipper's agent for any purpose, including, but not limited to, completion of the sale of the goods by the shipper to the recipient.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">9.     FedEx Ground C.O.D. shipments are not eligible for Hold at Location.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">10.  Additional restrictions may apply to C.O.D. deliveries to remote rural areas in Canada, including additional limitations on the maximum C.O.D. amount. Please contact FedEx Customer Service at <a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a> for more information.</p>
<p>B.    <b>Collect on Delivery Remittance:</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     Remittance of C.O.D. Collections. FedEx Ground will remit the C.O.D. collection to the shipper within 10 business days from date of collection. The C.O.D. amount will be collected and remitted in the currency of the destination country. Our sole obligation shall be to timely remit the C.O.D. collection through the U.S. Postal Service, and FedEx Ground shall not otherwise be liable for any loss or delay caused by the remittance of the C.O.D. collection.</p>
<p>C.   <b>FedEx Ground Electronic C.O.D.</b> <b>(E.C.O.D.)</b> E.C.O.D. service requires the approval of FedEx Ground for enrollment. (This service is not available for U.S.-to-Canada shipments.) If the shipper is approved by FedEx Ground for enrollment, the following shall apply:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     FedEx Ground E.C.O.D. provides C.O.D. payments for approved shippers by electronic funds transfer (EFT) within 24 or 48 hours after the funds are deposited into the FedEx Ground Bank account as described below. Shipper must choose either the 24- or 48-hour transfer option at time of enrollment.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     All checks received by FedEx Ground on behalf of the shipper shall be restrictively endorsed by FedEx Ground in substantially the following language and deposited into our terminal bank accounts (&quot;FedEx Ground Bank&quot;):<br />
FOR DEPOSIT ONLY<br />
FEDEX GROUND<br />
AS AGENT FOR THE WITHIN NAMED PAYEE<br />
LACK OF ENDORSEMENT GUARANTEED</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     C.O.D. checks shall be deposited into the FedEx Ground Bank account before the bank's close of business on the first business day following the delivery date. Upon deposit to FedEx Ground Bank, FedEx Ground shall cause the proceeds of all C.O.D. checks to be electronically transferred from FedEx Ground Bank to the shipper's bank as shown on a voided check supplied to FedEx Ground during the enrollment process.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     Shipper must notify FedEx Ground of any changes to shipper's bank, account, or routing instructions required for EFT. Once notice is received by the FedEx Ground C.O.D. department, changes to EFT instructions may take up to 10 business days to take effect.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.     If any check collected on behalf of the shipper is timely deposited by FedEx Ground but thereafter is dishonored and returned to our bank as non-negotiable, the risk of nonpayment shall lie with the shipper, and the shipper shall reimburse FedEx Ground for the face amount of such check and any bank charges associated with the return of the check (non-sufficient funds charges [&quot;NSF charges&quot;]) by permitting FedEx Ground to reduce subsequent electronic funds remittances by a like amount, provided that such returned check is promptly forwarded to the shipper by FedEx Ground to the shipper's address. In the event that E.C.O.D. remittances have not been sufficient to allow FedEx Ground to recover check amounts and associated NSF charges within 30 days, the shipper agrees to permit FedEx Ground to electronically deduct these fees from the shipper's named financial institution. FedEx Ground will return any NSF C.O.D. checks to shipper via FedEx 2Day service.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.     All collections in the form of cash shall be deposited into the FedEx Ground Bank account before the bank's close of business on the first business day following the delivery date.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">7.     If a bank does not allow a third-party endorsement of money orders or cashier's checks, the money order or cashier's check will be mailed back to the shipper, and the amount initially transferred electronically will be deducted from the shipper's subsequent E.C.O.D. remittances. In the event that E.C.O.D. remittances have not been sufficient to allow FedEx Ground to recover the amount initially transferred from subsequent E.C.O.D. remittances within 30 days, the shipper agrees to permit FedEx Ground to electronically deduct the amounts initially transferred from the shipper's named financial institution. Shipper agrees to permit FedEx Ground to also reduce the next electronic funds transfer for the shipping charges included in the money order or cashier's check.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">8.     On or before the end of each business day during participation in the E.C.O.D. program and thereafter so long as any funds belonging to the shipper remain in the possession or control of FedEx Ground, FedEx Ground will transmit the details of all deposits at the shipper's designated bank and/or FedEx Ground's bank and/or checks returned for insufficient funds to the shipper. Such reporting shall be provided to the shipper by either facsimile transmission or e-mail as selected by the shipper during the enrollment process.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">9.     In addition to the charge assessed for each C.O.D. package tendered to FedEx Ground by the shipper, an additional weekly service charge will be assessed for the E.C.O.D. service.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">10.  At its sole discretion, FedEx reserves the right to revoke a shipper's E.C.O.D. enrollment without notice.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    FedEx Ground does not provide individual consumer credit privileges.</p>
<p>B.    FedEx Ground will extend credit to shippers who, in the sole judgment of FedEx Ground, are creditworthy.</p>
<p>C.   As a condition of extending credit privileges, FedEx Ground reserves the right to require business customers to provide current financial information, agree to bank draft arrangements for payment on account, provide a security deposit or provide a bank letter of credit.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     Deposit Plan. After depositing an amount equivalent to four weeks' transportation charges as estimated by FedEx Ground, payments are required within 15 days of invoice date. The deposit amount is subject to change to reflect revised estimates of the shipper's charges.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     Under the deposit plan, no interest will be paid by FedEx Ground, nor will additional charges be rendered for their services. Net balances will be refunded at the request of the shipper.</p>
<p>D.   When credit privileges are extended, FedEx reserves the right to establish and enforce a credit limit on your account. At our sole discretion, we may review and amend a credit limit on your account.</p>
<p>E.    The invoice date begins the credit term cycle, and payment is due within 15 days from the invoice date. Failure to keep your FedEx account current will result in &quot;termination&quot; of your ground service.</p>
<p>F.    IF THE ACCOUNT NUMBER TO BE BILLED IS NOT IN GOOD CREDIT STANDING, THE PACKAGE MAY BE HELD OR STOPPED IN TRANSIT UNTIL YOU MAKE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS. THE MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE POLICY WILL NOT APPLY IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES.</p>
<p>G.   The shipper, and any other party who is liable for payment, is responsible for all reasonable costs incurred by FedEx Ground in obtaining or attempting to obtain payment for services rendered by FedEx Ground. Such costs include, but are not limited to, attorneys' fees, collection agency fees, interest and court costs.</p>
<p>H.   Credit privileges will not be restored until you have paid all past-due balances in full and all costs, fees and expenses incurred by FedEx Ground in collecting or attempting to collect such balances. FedEx Ground may require you to secure the account with a form of payment as a prerequisite to credit restoration. FedEx Ground may decline to restore credit privileges even if all costs, fees and expenses are paid.</p>
<p>I.      Customers requesting the reinstatement of their FedEx Ground service must contact the Recovery Collections department at <a href="tel:18005067580"><b>1.800.506.7580</b>.</a></p>

<p>B.    The declared value of any package represents our maximum liability in connection with a package, including, but not limited to, any loss, damage, delay, misdelivery, nondelivery, misinformation, any failure to provide information, or misdelivery of information. Exposure to and risk of any loss in excess of the declared value is either assumed by the shipper or transferred by the shipper to an insurance carrier through the purchase of an insurance policy. The shipper should contact an insurance agent or broker if insurance coverage is desired. FEDEX GROUND DOES NOT PROVIDE INSURANCE COVERAGE OF ANY KIND.</p>
<p>C.   In cases where the shipper declares or agrees in writing that the property being shipped is released to a value exceeding $100 per package or article not enclosed in a package, an additional charge for each $100 or fraction thereof of total valuation will be assessed to which the base rate applies, up to a maximum declared value of $50,000 per package.</p>
<p>D.   Packages containing all or part of the following items are limited to a maximum declared value of $1,000:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     Film, photographic images (including photographic negatives), photographic chromes and photographic slides.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     Any commodity that by its inherent nature is particularly susceptible to damage or the market value of which is particularly variable or difficult to ascertain.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     Antiques, or any commodity that exhibits the style or fashion of a past era and whose history, age or rarity contributes to its value. These items include, but are not limited to, furniture, tableware and glassware.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.     Glassware, including, but not limited to, signs, mirrors, ceramics, porcelains, china, crystal, glass, framed glass and any other commodity with similarly fragile qualities.</p>

<p>E.    ANY EFFORT TO DECLARE A VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE MAXIMUMS ALLOWED IN THE FEDEX SERVICE GUIDE IS NULL AND VOID. OUR ACCEPTANCE FOR CARRIAGE OF ANY PACKAGE BEARING A DECLARED VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE ALLOWED MAXIMUMS DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF ANY PROVISION OF THE FEDEX SERVICE GUIDE AS TO SUCH PACKAGE.</p>
<p>F.    REGARDLESS OF THE DECLARED VALUE OF A PACKAGE, OUR LIABILITY FOR LOSS, DAMAGE, DELAY, MISDELIVERY, NONDELIVERY, MISINFORMATION, ANY FAILURE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION, OR MISDELIVERY OF INFORMATION, WILL NOT EXCEED ITS REPAIR COST, ITS DEPRECIATED VALUE OR ITS REPLACEMENT COST, WHICHEVER IS LESS.</p>
<p>G.   See the Liabilities Not Assumed section for other limitations and exclusions on our liability.</p>
<p>H.   In the event that FedEx Office procures, accepts tender of, performs, or otherwise undertakes the transportation, delivery or release of a package by FedEx Ground, whether directly or indirectly, FedEx Office shall have the benefit of every right, defense, limitation and liberty of whatsoever nature contained in this tariff or otherwise available to FedEx Ground as if such provision were expressly for its benefit.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>Packages containing hazardous materials, including materials classified as &quot;Other Regulated Materials - Domestic&quot; (ORM-D) or Limited Quantity, cannot be shipped via FedEx international services, or to, from or within Hawaii or Alaska (consumer-commodity ORM-D and Limited Quantity can be shipped to Canada if properly labeled). Hazardous material shippers must be properly qualified through a FedEx sales representative before tendering hazardous material packages via FedEx Ground.</p>
<p>A.    All packages containing hazardous materials must be properly classified, described, packaged, marked, labeled and in proper condition for transportation according to applicable regulations and FedEx Ground requirements. FedEx Ground accepts only certain hazardous materials as listed in the current version of the FedEx Ground Hazardous Materials Table, which is available at fedex.com/hazardousmaterials (select the Resources page) and incorporated herein by reference. Contact a FedEx account executive, see fedex.com/hazardousmaterials or call<b> <a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a></b> and say &quot;hazardous materials&quot; for more information.</p>
<p>B.    FedEx Ground does not accept hazardous waste. This includes, but is not limited to, used hypodermic needles or syringes transported for sterilization, recycling, disposal or for any other purpose, or other medical waste. FedEx Ground also does not accept hazardous substances in reportable quantities.</p>
<p>C.   FedEx Ground does not accept infectious or non-infectious human or animal cells, tissue, bodily fluids, blood, blood products, plasma, or any other material derived from human or animal blood whether in liquid or solid form; biohazards; regulated or non-regulated diagnostic cultures, specimens or samples, whether infectious or non-infectious; used health care products as defined in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations; and any materials regulated as UN 2814, UN 2900, UN 3373 and UN 3291.</p>
<p>D.   FedEx Ground does not accept inhalation hazards.</p>
<p>E.    Hazardous materials, except ORM-D and Limited Quantity materials, cannot be banded, strapped or taped to form a bundle. Packaging restrictions and service restrictions apply. Unless other U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) restrictions apply, FedEx Ground does not accept hazardous materials over 70 lbs. (32 kg). FedEx Ground does not accept pails or drums over 8 gallons (32 liters). All pails or drums must be in performance-oriented packaging (POP). FedEx Ground will accept authorized pails or drums as single packaging. Hazardous materials may not be shipped in any FedEx packaging.</p>
<p>F.    Hazardous material shipments, including shipments containing ORM-D materials, Limited Quantity materials or dry ice, are not accepted at FedEx Drop Box locations, FedEx Office Print and Ship Center locations, FedEx Ship Center locations, FedEx Express station or ramp locations, FedEx Authorized ShipCenter locations, FedEx OnSite locations, and unstaffed FedEx locations.</p>
<p>G.   Batteries, including lithium batteries, may be regulated when shipped for highway transport. Shippers should refer to the most current U.S. Department of Transportation regulations to ensure compliance with marking, labeling and packaging requirements as they pertain to the transportation of batteries. Additional restrictions may apply to the transportation of lithium batteries between the contiguous U.S. and Alaska and Hawaii. For details, go to fedex.com and enter keyword &quot;lithium batteries.&quot; FedEx Ground does not accept damaged batteries or defective batteries that pose a safety risk.</p>
<p>H.   Packages containing hazardous materials are not eligible for FedEx Ground return options, except for packages shipped by preapproved shippers using the FedEx Ground Package Returns Program.</p>
<p>I.      All damaged or leaking hazardous material packages may be properly repackaged, prepared in accordance with applicable DOT regulations and returned to the shipper. The undamaged portion of a damaged hazardous materials shipment will be returned to the shipper for recycling, reprocessing or disposal. If the shipper refuses to accept the returned shipment, or if the shipment cannot be returned to the shipper, as determined at our sole discretion, the shipper is responsible for and will reimburse FedEx Ground for all costs and fees of any type connected with the legal disposal of the shipment and all costs and fees of any type connected with cleanup of any spill or leakage. The minimum reimbursement per package is $US350.</p>
<p>J.     No service guarantees (e.g., no FedEx Money-Back Guarantee) will apply to packages not properly prepared in accordance with DOT regulations and FedEx Ground requirements.</p>
<p>K.    Hazardous material packages found in the FedEx Ground system not properly prepared in accordance with DOT regulations and FedEx Ground requirements will be held for customer pickup. If the shipper refuses to pick up or make other arrangements for delivery acceptable to FedEx Ground, the shipper will reimburse FedEx Ground for all costs and fees of any type connected with the legal disposal of the shipment. The shipper agrees to indemnify FedEx Ground for any and all costs, fees and expenses FedEx Ground incurs as a result of the shipper's failure to comply with FedEx Hazardous Materials shipping requirements. The minimum reimbursement per package is $US350.</p>
<p>L.    In the event the shipper loads any FedEx Ground vehicle, the shipper agrees to segregate hazardous materials in accordance with regulations.</p>
<p>M.   The shipper may be held accountable for all costs associated with any damaged or leaking hazardous material package that is not properly prepared in accordance with all DOT regulations and FedEx Ground requirements. Cost may include response, cleanup and disposal.</p>
<p>N.   Materials classified as ORM-D or Limited Quantity are the only hazardous materials that can be shipped via FedEx Home Delivery.</p>
<p>O.   Packages containing hazardous materials are not eligible for signature release, driver release or indirect delivery.</p>
<p>P.    <b>Charge for Handling Hazardous Materials.</b> In addition to the other rates and charges named in this tariff, a charge will be assessed on each package of hazardous materials.</p>
<p>Q.   The shipper is required to transmit hazardous material shipping information using a FedEx electronic shipping solution, a FedEx-recognized hazardous materials vendor software application, a FedEx Compatible Solutions Program application or a custom solution that has the ability to transmit hazardous material shipping information electronically.</p>

Any civil claim for, including, but not limited to, any loss, damage, delay, misdelivery, nondelivery, misinformation, any failure to provide information, or misdelivery of information relating to the shipment, must be brought within two years and one day from the date FedEx Ground gives written notice that FedEx Ground has disallowed any part of the claim specified in the notice. <br />
 <br />
 Any right you might have to damages, refunds, credits recovery of reliance interests, disgorgement, restitution, injunctive relief, declaratory relief or any other legal or equitable relief whatsoever against FedEx Ground under any cause of action arising from the transportation of any package pursuant to the FedEx Service Guide shall be extinguished unless you first comply with all applicable notice periods and requirements in this tariff including, but not limited to, the periods and requirements for providing notice under the Billing, Claims and Money-Back Guarantee Policy sections. You and FedEx Ground understand that timely and complete compliance with such notice periods and requirements is a contractual condition precedent to your right to any relief whatsoever, and you must plead compliance with those conditions precedent on the face of any complaint that you file against FedEx Ground. You and FedEx Ground agree that FedEx Ground cannot be considered to have breached any obligation to you unless or until FedEx Ground wrongfully denies a claim submitted to FedEx Ground pursuant to the notice periods and requirements contained in this tariff. Finally, you and FedEx Ground agree that you will comply with applicable notice periods and requirements even if you believe that such compliance will not result in relief from FedEx Ground or if you lack knowledge regarding whether such compliance will result in relief from FedEx Ground.<br />
 <br />
 You agree that you will not sue FedEx Ground as a class plaintiff or class representative, join as a class member, or participate as an adverse party in any way in a class-action lawsuit against FedEx Ground. Nothing in this paragraph, however, limits your rights to bring a lawsuit as an individual plaintiff.<br />
 <br />
 To the extent that any court finds that state rather than federal law applies to any provision of this contract, the controlling law is the substantive law of the state in which you tendered your shipment to FedEx Ground.<br />
 <br />
 The performance of any services does not make FedEx Ground an agent of the shipper or any third party for any purpose.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>We offer a money-back guarantee for our services. This guarantee can be suspended, modified or revoked at our sole discretion without prior notice to you.</p>
<p>A.    <b>Money-Back Guarantee Policy.</b><br />
The money-back guarantee is your exclusive remedy in the event of a service failure for the recovery of all or any portion of the FedEx charges for a shipment. If the money-back guarantee is suspended, there is no remedy or recovery of charges for a service failure. There are no delivery commitments for shipments on which the money-back guarantee is suspended.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     <b>FedEx Ground Money-Back Guarantee.</b> At our option, we will, upon request, either refund or credit your transportation charges in the event of a service failure (which means if FedEx does not deliver the shipper's standard ground and multiweight ground package[s] by the end of the scheduled delivery day as published on fedex.com).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     <b>FedEx Home Delivery Money-Back Guarantee.</b> At our option, we will, upon request, either refund or credit your transportation charges and residential surcharge in the event of a service failure (which means if FedEx does not deliver the shipper's residential package[s] by the end of the scheduled delivery day as published on fedex.com). For shipments designated as FedEx Date Certain Home Delivery, FedEx Evening Home Delivery or FedEx Appointment Home Delivery, see the FedEx Home Delivery Money-Back Guarantee for Convenient Delivery Options section below.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     <b>FedEx Home Delivery Money-Back Guarantee for Convenient Delivery Options.</b> At our option, we will, upon request, either refund or credit your transportation charges, residential surcharge and the applicable convenient delivery option charge in the event of a service failure (which means if FedEx does not provide the FedEx Home Delivery convenient delivery option requested for the shipper's package[s], as described below).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">a.     <b>FedEx Date Certain Home Delivery Money-Back Guarantee.</b> The FedEx Date Certain Home Delivery Money-Back Guarantee applies if the shipment is not delivered on the valid date requested. To be considered valid, the requested date must be no earlier than the scheduled delivery as published on fedex.com; cannot be a Sunday or a FedEx holiday; and must be within 14 days from the pickup date. If the delivery date requested is invalid, the FedEx Date Certain Home Delivery Money-Back Guarantee will not apply.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">b.     <b>FedEx Evening Home Delivery Money-Back Guarantee.</b> The FedEx Evening Home Delivery Money-Back Guarantee applies if the shipment is not delivered between 5 and 8 p.m. on or before the scheduled delivery date as published on fedex.com.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">c.     <b>FedEx Appointment Home Delivery Money-Back Guarantee.</b> The FedEx Appointment Home Delivery Money-Back Guarantee applies if the shipment is not delivered within one hour before or after the time, and on the date, requested by the recipient and agreed to by FedEx.</p>
<p>B.    <b>Limitations.</b> The following limitations apply:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     A credit or refund under the money-back guarantee will be applied only against charges for the shipment giving rise to the credit.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     At the sole discretion of FedEx, the money-back guarantee may not be honored when the request is made by, or the information utilized to determine the status of the package is determined by, a third party other than the payer of the charges.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     The FedEx Ground Money-Back Guarantee applies to deliveries within the U.S. For shipments destined to Canada, the FedEx Money-Back Guarantee only applies to transportation charges related to brokerage-inclusive service.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     If FedEx Ground utilizes the U.S. Postal Service or an interline cartage agent for delivery to remote rural areas, the money-back guarantee only applies to the portion of transportation provided directly by FedEx Ground.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.     Packages tendered to FedEx Ground for delivery on the day after Thanksgiving will be scheduled for delivery on that day if the recipient business is open, but in any event, the delivery commitment will be extended to the next business day for application of the money-back guarantee.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.     Packages tendered for delivery on holidays that are business days for FedEx Ground (for example, Good Friday and Presidents Day) will be scheduled for delivery on that day if the recipient business is open. However, if the recipient business is known by FedEx Ground to be closed due to the holiday, the packages will be scheduled for delivery on the next business day the recipient is open, but the money-back guarantee will not apply.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">7.     To be eligible for the FedEx Home Delivery Money-Back Guarantee for Convenient Delivery Options, the shipper must have fulfilled the following conditions:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">a.     Prepare and attach to each package a 128 bar-code label showing the delivery option requested. The shipper must also provide FedEx Ground with the required electronic information for the service level selected.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">b.     Convenient delivery options are offered at the shipment level. To qualify as a shipment, one or more packages must have the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120.0px;">○ The same shipper number</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120.0px;">○ The same origin location</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120.0px;">○ The same ship date</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120.0px;">○ The same recipient address</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120.0px;">○ The same convenient delivery option selected</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">8.     If a delivery later than the original scheduled delivery day or time is requested by the shipper or recipient before the first delivery attempt is made, the delivery commitment for application of the money-back guarantee policy will be adjusted to account for the requested delivery date and/or time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">9.     If the shipper or recipient informed FedEx that the recipient location is closed on a certain day or at a certain time, or unavailable to accept delivery, the delivery commitment for application of the money-back guarantee policy will be the next business day.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">10.     If the package is placed in a FedEx Drop Box, the delivery commitment for application of the money-back guarantee will be extended by 1 business day.</p>
<p>C.   <b>Exceptions.</b> FedEx will not be obligated to refund or credit your transportation charges, residential surcharge or convenient delivery option charge if:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     We provide you with proof of timely delivery, consisting of the date and time of delivery and, if applicable, the name of the person who signed for the shipment, or service-exception information reflecting that the failure to deliver timely resulted from circumstances described under the Liabilities Not Assumed section.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     The service failure resulted, in whole or in part, from any of the circumstances described under the Liabilities Not Assumed section.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     The shipper did not properly label the package in accordance with the FedEx Service Guide, including, without limitation, affixing the correct business name and contact name (for FedEx Ground packages) or recipient name (for FedEx Home Delivery packages) and deliverable address (number, street, city, state, and a five-digit ZIP code) and correctly placing the customer-specific FedEx Ground or FedEx Home Delivery bar-code label on the package. For FedEx Home Delivery packages, the shipper must print the letter &quot;H&quot; (Home) on the address label in accordance with the FedEx Home Delivery label specifications.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     The shipper did not timely and accurately transmit all electronic package-level data required, including, but not limited to, any electronic package-level data necessary for package sorting by FedEx Ground, to the extent required by the Shipper's Agreement with FedEx Ground. For FedEx Appointment Home Delivery shipments, a valid telephone number for the recipient must be included in the data-entry information when the shipment is processed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.     The package was not picked up by a FedEx Ground driver at the shipper's location or an alternate address location, at a FedEx Office Print and Ship Center, at a FedEx Ship Center, at a FedEx Authorized ShipCenter or at a FedEx Drop Box prior to that location's regular scheduled pickup time. If a package is accepted by FedEx Ground after a location's regular scheduled pickup time, an additional transit day may be added to the scheduled delivery date.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.     The package was tendered for transportation on the Monday after Thanksgiving through Christmas Eve.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">7.     The shipment contained special instructions, including, but not limited to, FedEx Ground Call Tag service and FedEx Delivery Signature Options.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">8.     There was an unexpected large release of packages from your shipping location.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">9.     The package met the definitions for additional handling, address correction, oversize or unauthorized. See the Fees and Other Shipping Information section of the FedEx Service Guide for additional details.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">10.  FedEx received a request to redirect the shipment from a delivery address to a Hold at Location address.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">11.  The shipment was undeliverable or returned.</p>
<p>D.   <b>Refund or Credit Requests.</b> To qualify for a refund or credit due to a service failure, you must notify us of the service failure and request a refund or credit in compliance with the conditions listed below. If you do not comply with these conditions, you are not entitled to receive a refund or credit and cannot recover compensation for a service failure in any lawsuit.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     You may request a refund or credit due to a service failure in the following ways:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">a.     Use our internet application FedEx Billing Online at fedex.com if you are a registered user; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">b.     Submit your request through the invoice adjustment feature at fedex.com; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">c.     Submit the request via our telephone invoice adjustment system at <b><a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a></b> (say &quot;billing&quot;).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;"><i>Note:</i> Requests for a refund of FedEx Delivery Manager delivery-option fees must be made by the recipient online at fedex.com/billingadjustment. See FedEx Delivery Manager Terms in the fedex.com Terms of Use.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     Your notification of a service failure must include your FedEx tracking number and invoice number, if applicable.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     All requests for a refund or credit must be received via one of the approved channels within 15 calendar days of the invoice date or within 15 calendar days from the ship date if you are paying by credit card or in advance by cash, check or money order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     A partial payment against an invoice is not considered a request for invoice adjustment or notice of a refund request. A notification of the reason for an unpaid charge with your payment is not considered a request for an invoice adjustment or notice of a refund request if the reason relates to a service failure.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>Package Consolidators are responsible for complying with all applicable requirements in this tariff including, but not limited to, customs and other legal requirements applicable to packages tendered for international transportation.</p>
<p>If you tender packages to a Package Consolidator instead of to us directly, the following limitations apply:</p>
<p>A.  Package Consolidators are not agents of FedEx, and we are not responsible for any errors or omissions made by them.</p>
<p>B.  Package Consolidators may submit claims for refunds or credits for shipping charges under the money-back guarantee policy. Neither the person or entity tendering the package to the Package Consolidator nor the recipient is eligible for refunds or credits under the money-back guarantee policy.</p>
<p>C.  In order for a Package Consolidator to receive packaging supplies from FedEx, the Package Consolidator must first enter into a Packaging and Pricing Agreement or a FedEx Authorized ShipCenter Agreement with FedEx.</p>
<p>D.  Package Consolidators may charge FedEx Retail Rates for FedEx shipping services, but they are not required to. Package Consolidators set their own rates for reselling FedEx services.</p>
<p>E.  Package Consolidators are not required to have the FedEx Ground Declared Value Shipment Form at their location. Dropoff customers should bring their own FedEx Ground Declared Value Shipment Form to the Package Consolidator with declared value dropoff packages.</p>
<p>F.  FedEx Ground assumes no liability, other than to the Package Consolidator, for lost, damaged or delayed shipments tendered to a Package Consolidator, as the Package Consolidator is the shipper of these packages. The Package Consolidator’s barcode must appear as the shipper’s bar code for all shipments paid for at a Package Consolidator. Package Consolidators are independently owned and operated businesses.</p>
<p>G.  See the Package Consolidator representative for information regarding rates and services and the terms and conditions of carriage. Inquiries or claims regarding shipments tendered to a Package Consolidator must also be directed to the Package Consolidator.</p>
<p>H.  As directed by FedEx, Package Consolidators must require a government-issued photo ID to validate the identity of their customer and must keep a record of the name and address on the ID of their customer for each package.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">a.     Regular-Shaped Packages: The length and girth of a package is length plus (two times the height) plus (two times the width). If the dimension includes a fraction, a fraction of one-half or greater will be rounded up to the next whole number; less than one-half will be rounded down to the next whole number.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">b.     Irregular-Shaped Packages and Regular-Shaped Articles With Hollow or Open Spaces: To measure combined length and girth, assume the package or article to be enclosed in a six-sided, rectangular container, and then determine the combined length and girth as for regular-shaped packages.</p>
<p>B.    <b>Charge for Unauthorized Packages.</b> In addition to the other rates and charges named in this tariff, a charge will be assessed for the following conditions:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.    Any package measuring more than 108 inches in length.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.   Any package measuring more than 165 inches in length and girth combined.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.   Any package weighing more than 150 lbs.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Unauthorized packages will be rated based on the greater of the package's actual rounded weight or dimensional weight, subject to a 90-lb. minimum billable weight.</p>
<p><span class="fxg-font-size-12"><i><sup>1</sup>These packages are unauthorized and may be refused, returned to the shipper or disposed of by FedEx Ground. However, at FedEx Ground's sole discretion, they may be accepted and delivered. In the event of disposal, the shipper, if known, agrees to pay any costs incurred in the disposal.  </i></span></p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    All packages must be prepared and packed by the sender for safe transportation with ordinary care in handling. Recipient address labels should be placed on both sides of each package with an additional label enclosed inside. Any articles susceptible to damage as a result of conditions that may be encountered in air ground transportation, such as changes in temperature, must be adequately protected by proper packaging. Each shipment must be legibly and durably marked with the name, address and ZIP code of both the shipper and recipient. The ZIP code is crucial to the efficient movement of the package through the FedEx Ground system.</p>
<p>New corrugated boxes in good, rigid condition large enough to allow cushioning of contents on the top, bottom and sides should be used. For guidelines on packaging specific commodities go to fedex.com/packaging. Items that cannot be packed into cartons (auto tail pipes, mufflers, tires, rims, and so on) must have all sharp edges and protrusions wrapped, and the address label must be secured using the tie-on tag or the tire/crate label provided by FedEx (or you may secure it by wrapping pressure-sensitive tape completely around the object). Briefcases, luggage, garment bags, aluminum cases, plastic cases, computer cartons or similar types of items whose outer finish might be damaged by adhesive labels, soiling, marking or other types of surface damage that is normal with ordinary care in handling should be placed in a protective container for shipment. Casters, wheels or rollers must be removed or packaged.</p>
<p>Expanded polystyrene foam coolers must be shipped inside a sturdy outer container unless tested and approved for acceptance by FedEx Packaging Design and Development. Information on how to submit your packaging for testing is available at fedex.com/packaging.</p>
<p>B.    If a shipment is refused by the recipient, leaks, or is damaged, the shipment will be returned to the sender, if possible. If the sender refuses to accept the returned shipment or it cannot be returned because of leakage or damage due to faulty packaging, the shipper is responsible for and will reimburse FedEx Ground for all costs and fees of any type connected with the legal disposal of the shipment and all costs and fees of any type connected with cleanup of any spill or leakage.</p>
<p>C.   <b>Fragile Articles/Orientation.</b> Packaging for all fragile articles (including, but not limited to, electronic and electrical devices, scientific testing equipment, fragile glass, crystal, porcelain, or china) should be preapproved by FedEx Packaging Design and Development prior to shipping.</p>
<p>D.   <b>Package Inspection and Testing.</b> FedEx Ground reserves the right to request a shipper to submit a representative sampling of the packaging for inspection and testing. If the shipper fails to comply with our request to inspect and test the packaging or the sampling fails FedEx testing, FedEx Ground will not be liable for any damages due to improper packaging.</p>
<p>E.    FedEx Ground may issue written notice to you if you repeatedly fail to adhere to FedEx Ground's packaging requirements due to your pattern or practice of insufficient packaging. Claims for damage or loss associated with an identified pattern or practice of insufficient packaging will be denied. Any such claim filed related to your shipments will not be paid, regardless of which party files the claim, unless the claimant can establish that the loss or damage did not result from a failure to use proper packaging. FedEx Ground will continue to deny such claims until we determine that you have ceased the pattern or practice of failing to adhere to the packaging requirements. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to limit FedEx Ground's right to deny a claim where the shipment in dispute is found to have improper packaging.</p>
<p>F.    <b>Preshipment Inspection and Testing for Oversize Packages.</b> Preshipment Inspection and Testing for Oversize Packages. At the sole discretion of FedEx Ground, FedEx Ground may require a shipper of packages classified as Oversize, as defined in the Rates section of the FedEx Service Guide, to submit a representative sampling of the oversize packaging for inspection and testing. If the shipper fails to comply with our request to inspect and test oversize packaging or the sampling fails FedEx testing, FedEx Ground will not be liable for any damage to shipper's oversize packages.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    <b>Pickup Service:</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     FedEx Ground may provide on-call pickup service for a per-package pickup fee for customers that do not have a FedEx Ground regular scheduled pickup. This fee may be higher if the pickup is made the same day it is requested or if the request is made through FedEx Customer Service.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     FedEx Ground may provide pickup service for a weekly pickup fee to regular scheduled pickup customers.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     An alternate address pickup fee may apply to pickup service at shipping locations other than the location associated with the FedEx Ground account number. The alternate address pickup fee only applies to account numbers assessed the weekly pickup fee.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     Charges for pickup service shall apply in addition to the rates set forth in the FedEx Service Guide in effect at the time of shipment. Upon payment of the applicable pickup service charge, FedEx Ground will call at the shipper's premises once each business day, if required, to pick up packages for delivery to all points served by FedEx Ground.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.     A return pickup surcharge applies for FedEx Print Return Label and FedEx Email Return Label shipments.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.     The shipper agrees to declare all applicable additional charges on the Customer Shipping Record or Declared Value Shipment Form, if applicable. FedEx Ground reserves the right to assess additional charges on those packages that the shipper does not properly rate and to re-rate packages the shipper fails to rate properly.</p>
<p>B.    <b>Delivery.</b> FedEx Ground does not offer a restricted-delivery service and may deliver to someone other than the person or entity named as the recipient. We also may make an indirect delivery. Indirect delivery is a completed delivery to an address or location other than the address on the label and includes shipments delivered via Indirect Signature Required service. FedEx Ground may release the package with no signature at a residential address if none of the FedEx Delivery Signature Options are selected. FedEx Ground will attempt to obtain a signature for shipments to nonresidential addresses, except that when FedEx Ground uses a postal service, an interline cartage agent or a freight forwarder for final delivery, we may release such shipments with no signature if a FedEx Delivery Signature Option is not selected. If a Delivery Signature Option is selected and FedEx Ground uses a postal service, an interline cartage agent or a freight forwarder for final delivery, one of the following may occur at FedEx Ground’s discretion:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     If available, a cartage agent that can return a signature may be selected; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     If a signature cannot be returned, FedEx Ground may call the shipper and request to eliminate the signature requirement; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     The package may be returned to the shipper.</p>
<p>Where a signature is required, FedEx will make up to three attempts at delivery. A notice that delivery has been attempted will be left at the recipient's address after the first and second attempts. (See the Delivery Signature Options section.)<br />
<br />
At our sole discretion, shipments having a declared value of $500 or greater in the currency of the destination country may not be released without a signature even where the release is otherwise authorized.<br />
<br />
FedEx Ground may, at its sole discretion, utilize a postal service, an interline cartage agent or a freight forwarding service for deliveries to remote rural areas or in the event of extreme or unexpected seasonal package volume, which may result in additional transit days and/or service restrictions. Our use of a postal service, an interline cartage agent or a freight forwarding service constitutes delivery of the shipment by us for all purposes. Please contact FedEx Customer Service at <a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a> for more information.<br />
<br />
Shipments to hotels, hospitals, government offices or installations, university campuses, or other facilities that utilize a mailroom or other central receiving area will be delivered to the central receiving area, unless otherwise authorized and approved by FedEx Ground.<br />
<br />
In order to facilitate delivery or release of a shipment, FedEx Ground may, at its sole discretion, contact the recipient to obtain delivery instructions, or to notify them that a delivery is scheduled, that a delivery has been completed or that a shipment is available for pickup at a Hold at Location facility. FedEx may also accept requests for delivery options from a recipient using FedEx Delivery Manager.<br />
<br />
At its discretion, FedEx may not deliver or attempt delivery on the scheduled delivery day if the shipper or recipient requested a later delivery or informed FedEx that the recipient is closed or unavailable to accept delivery on the scheduled delivery day. In this situation, charges will be assessed based on the service initially selected by the shipper. The shipper or payer is responsible for communicating with the recipient regarding requested later delivery times and is responsible for knowing the days and times that the recipient location can accept FedEx deliveries.<br />
<br />
We reserve the right to assess a Residential Delivery surcharge on any shipment delivered to a home or private residence, including locations where a business is operated from a home, or on any shipment in which the shipper has designated the delivery address as a residence, including shipments where the delivery location has been designated as Residential Delivery in error.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>C.   <b>Redirect to Hold at Location:</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     The shipper or recipient may request to redirect a package to a FedEx Office location within the FedEx Ground/FedEx Home Delivery terminal delivery area of the original address.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     Shipments that are requested to be redirected to Hold at Location are not eligible for the FedEx money-back guarantee.</p>

The contents of a return shipment are subject to the same restrictions and prohibited-item limitations as the original shipment.</p>
<p>B.    Written authorization from FedEx Ground is required to participate in the Package Returns Program (PRP). The maximum liability assumed by FedEx Ground for packages returned through PRP, FedEx Print Return Label or FedEx Email Return Label is limited to $100 unless a higher value is declared, up to a maximum of $1,000, at time of tender and a greater charge paid (see the Declared Value and Limits of Liability section). The shipper may declare a value up to $50,000 for packages returned through the FedEx Ground Call Tag. The declared value of the FedEx Ground Call Tag may not exceed the value of the declared value on the original shipment. The shipper may not declare a value for a package returned to FedEx Ground through a damage call tag. FedEx Ground shall not be liable for any damage to a shipment or claim arising out of the use of a return option unless the package was lost during shipment or there was visible damage noted by the driver at time of delivery. FedEx Ground shall not be liable for any concealed damage for items returned by using PRP, FedEx Print Return Label or FedEx Email Return Label. Receipt of a shipment without written notice of damage on the delivery record is prima facie evidence that the shipment was delivered in good condition. The FedEx Ground liability for any loss or damage arising out of an authorized return shipment shall never exceed the actual amount of damage or the declared amount, whichever is lower.

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>An undeliverable shipment is one that cannot be delivered for reasons that include, but are not limited to, any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The recipient refuses to pay for a bill-recipient shipment.</li>
<li>The recipient of a Hold at Location shipment cannot be located.</li>
<li>The recipient refuses to accept the shipment prior to, during or after delivery.</li>
<li>The recipient's delivery address cannot be located.</li>
<li>The shipment was addressed to an area not served by FedEx.</li>
<li>The shipment's contents or packaging are damaged to the point that rewrapping is not possible.</li>
<li>The shipment would likely cause damage or delay to other shipments or property or injury to personnel.</li>
<li>The shipment contains prohibited items.</li>
<li>The recipient's place of business is closed.</li>
<li>No appropriate person was available to accept the shipment at a delivery location on the initial delivery attempt or reattempts.</li>
<li>The shipment was improperly packaged.</li>
<li>The shipment contains unauthorized packages (see the Package Restrictions [Size and Weight] section).</li>
</ul>
<p>A.    Undeliverable shipments may be returned at the payer's expense. Shipments will be returned at no additional charge if the shipment is undeliverable because of damage to the shipment caused by FedEx. However, if the shipment is undeliverable for any other reason, FedEx Ground reserves the right to assess return transportation charges and fees to the original payer, along with the original transportation charges and fees.</p>
<p>B.    Our money-back guarantee policy does not apply to undeliverable or returned shipments.</p>
<p>C.   FedEx reserves the right, at its sole discretion, and without notice, to sell, destroy or otherwise dispose of undeliverable shipments. By tendering a shipment, the shipper agrees to transfer and convey good and sufficient title of the contents of undeliverable shipments to FedEx, and agrees to pay any costs incurred in the sale, destruction or disposal thereof.</p>

<input id="justifyRteRtl" type="hidden" value="false"/>


<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>In addition to the preceding terms and conditions, the additional terms and conditions below apply exclusively to international shipments to Canada.</p>
<p>A.    <b>Billing:</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     Invoicing. Duties, taxes, clearance entry (brokerage) fees and ancillary clearance service fees may be assessed on the contents of shipments destined for Canada. These are payable by the importer of record (normally the consignee, unless otherwise indicated) in the first instance. For FedEx International Ground brokerage-inclusive shipments, duties and taxes may be billed to the shipper, recipient or third party. If a clearance entry fee applies, the payer of duties and taxes will be billed for the clearance entry fee. Charges to the shipper's account in currencies other than U.S. dollars will be converted to U.S. dollars, using a weekly Wall Street Journal conversion rate corresponding to the pickup date of the shipment or, for FedEx International Ground Distribution, the date FedEx Ground takes possession of the shipment. A service fee may apply. The clearance entry fee is subject to all applicable Canadian taxes.<br />
<br />
Regardless of any payment instructions to the contrary, the shipper is ultimately liable for all charges and fees relating to a shipment, including, but not limited to, any duties or taxes that FedEx Ground has advanced. Shippers are responsible for accurately completing all sections of the required export documentation and for the entry of accurate shipment information (including, but not limited to, commodity descriptions and values for duty) on the Commercial Invoice and in any electronic device or software program.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     The shipper is responsible for all charges, including transportation charges, duties and clearance entry (brokerage) fees, ancillary clearance service fees, governmental penalties and fines, taxes, FedEx Ground attorney fees and legal costs related to this shipment, and charges related to broker unassigned shipments, or broker select shipments where the broker information provided is incorrect. The shipper will also be responsible for any cost FedEx Ground may incur in returning shipments to the shipper or warehousing them, pending disposition.</p>
<p>B.    <b>Consolidation Service.</b> Shippers utilizing FedEx International Ground Consolidation must meet all requirements as stated in the program-requirements document. By utilizing this consolidation service, the shipper agrees that:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     FedEx Ground will determine in its sole discretion which shipments will be consolidated or excluded from a consolidation.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     FedEx Ground is not liable for any increased brokerage costs associated with shipments that are not ultimately consolidated and clear customs as separate shipments. Any non-consolidated shipment may require a separate customs brokerage charge.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.    FedEx Ground reserves the right to update program requirements and participant eligibility at any time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.    All associated fees, limitations, liabilities not assumed and other terms of this FedEx Ground Tariff apply to any packages shipped under this program.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">Please contact FedEx Customer Service at <a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a> for more information.</p>
<p>C.   <b>Customs Clearance.</b> Brokerage-inclusive service is the automatic default for FedEx International Ground shipping on FedEx electronic shipping solutions. In some instances, at the option of FedEx Ground, FedEx Ground may accept instructions from the importer of record to use a designated customs broker other than the broker arranged by FedEx Ground or the broker designated by the shipper. In this case, the shipment will no longer be considered a brokerage-inclusive shipment.<br />
<br />
When FedEx Ground arranges clearance services, a clearance entry fee will be added as an ancillary clearance service fee to the duty-and-tax invoice to cover processes required to check the Commercial Invoice submitted with the shipment and to complete entry preparation procedures required by either U.S. Customs and Border Protection or the Canada Border Services Agency, including calculation of applicable duties and taxes for each type of commodity included in the shipment.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     U.S. Export Shipments. FedEx Ground is headquartered in the U.S. and will not transport shipments that violate U.S. export controls nor export controls in the countries in which we operate, provided they do not conflict with U.S. law. You are responsible for, and warrant, your compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the U.S. Foreign Assets Control Regulations and applicable export laws and regulations of any country to, from, through or over which your shipment may be transported. You agree, and warrant, that you will comply with all applicable U.S. government sanctions prohibiting the export or re-export of goods, services or technology to countries and regions listed by the U.S. government unilaterally or in coordination with other countries’ sanctions. In addition, no commodities originating or manufactured in any of these countries and regions are accepted for transportation anywhere in the world.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">Any FedEx Returns service shipments that are forwarded to a third country must also comply with the export control requirements of the country of first departure. You agree to furnish such information and complete and attach to the shipment such documents as necessary to comply with such laws, rules and regulations.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">In addition, you specifically warrant that you will not tender any shipments to us if you or any of the parties involved in the shipment are listed on any of the export controls or sanctions lists published and maintained by: the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control; the U.S. Department of Commerce Department, Bureau of Industry and Security; the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls; the United Nations Sanctions Committees; the European Union Council; and any other relevant authority. In addition, you agree and warrant that you will not attempt to ship to any entity owned by any party, in the common ownership interest determined by the relevant listing authority, subject to U.S. government economic sanctions. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">We assume no liability to you or any other person for any loss or expense — including, but not limited to, fines and penalties — if you fail to comply with any export laws, rules or regulations.<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">Shipments crossing international borders must be cleared through customs in the destination country before being delivered to the consignee. You are responsible for providing FedEx with the importer of record's customs broker. This can be done by entering broker information on the Commercial Invoice or by selecting the broker select option and entering broker information in the automation device. If the importer of record is self-clearing the shipment through customs, you must specifically indicate that on the shipment documentation or clearance fees may apply.<br />
<br />
The shipper agrees to provide all required documentation for the customs clearance and certifies that all statements and information on said documentation, including documentation submitted electronically, are true and correct. The shipper authorizes FedEx Ground to forward all information of any nature regarding shipments to any and all governmental or regulatory agencies that request or require such information. The shipper understands that making false declarations or statements may result in civil and criminal penalties, including forfeiture and sale.<br />
<br />
If the shipper does not complete all documents required for carriage, or if the documents submitted are not appropriate for the services or destinations specified, the shipper hereby authorizes FedEx Ground, where permitted by law, to complete, correct or replace the documents for the shipper at the shipper's expense. However, FedEx Ground is not obligated to do so.<br />
<br />
If a substitute form of Commercial Invoice is needed to complete delivery of the shipment, and FedEx Ground completes such a document, the terms of this tariff will continue to govern.<br />
<br />
When shipments are held by customs or other agencies because of incorrect or missing documentation, FedEx Ground may attempt to notify the consignee or shipper, as determined by local law. If the consignee or shipper fails to supply the required information or documentation, the shipment may be determined to be undeliverable. FedEx Ground assumes no responsibility for the inability to complete a delivery due to incorrect or missing documentation. Shipments held by customs or other agencies because of incorrect or missing documentation will require additional transit time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     U.S. Import Shipments. Shipments originating outside the U.S. for delivery in the U.S. are subject to local tariffs and the service conditions of FedEx Ground. These service conditions include terms regarding the importation and customs clearance of shipments into the U.S. from Canada.<br />
<br />
U.S. Customs regulations require the Social Security Number (SSN) of an individual and the Internal Revenue Service Employer Identification Number (EIN) of the U.S. consignee for certain shipments being imported into the U.S. This information must be included on the Commercial Invoice for all U.S. import shipments. The EIN or SSN must be on file with the U.S. Customs Service. Any changes to a company address, or the EIN or SSN, should be provided to FedEx Ground for system updating. Shipments that arrive in the U.S. that do not have the correct EIN or SSN may be detained until that information can be obtained from the consignee or determined otherwise. This requirement applies to shipments imported to the U.S. requiring a formal entry.</p>
<p>D.   <b>Duties and Taxes.</b> In order to expedite customs clearance, FedEx Ground may elect to disburse duties and taxes on the importer's behalf. A FedEx Ground agent or employee may contact the importer to confirm arrangements for reimbursement of amounts to be disbursed. For brokerage-inclusive shipments, duties and taxes may generally be billed to the shipper, consignee or third party as designated on the Commercial Invoice or entered in an automation device.</p>
<p>E.    <b>Inspection of Shipments and Identification Requirement.</b> FedEx Ground, or its agents or brokers, may open and inspect any or all packages in a shipment at any time. This action may be initiated by FedEx Ground or at the request of government authorities. We may, at our sole discretion, require the shipper to provide their government-issued photo identification prior to tendering a package to FedEx.<br />
</p>
<p>F.    <b>Northern Canada Surcharge.</b> Canada packages destined to the Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Labrador are restricted to a maximum 70-lb. weight limit and will incur an additional charge. Packages weighing more than 70 lbs. may be refused or returned to the shipper. However, at FedEx Ground’s sole discretion, they may be accepted and delivered for an additional charge. These additional charges apply to postal codes A0K, A0P–A0R, A2V and X0A–Y9Z. The charges are in addition to applicable transportation charges.</p>
<p>G.   <b>Postal Codes and Telephone Numbers.</b> The consignee's postal code, telephone number and contact name are critical information and should be included on both the Commercial Invoice and address label.</p>
<p>H.   <b>Prohibited Items.</b> You are prohibited from tendering the following items for shipment to Canada, and you agree not to do so. This list is not all-inclusive and is subject to modification without notice. FedEx Ground reserves the right to open and inspect any package tendered for delivery. FedEx Ground will refuse and may return any shipment that is considered unsafe, unlawful, or violates the terms and conditions of the FedEx Ground Tariff.</p>

Consult fedex.com/globalreturns for details on return shipments.<br />
<br />
FOR SHIPMENTS INITIATED VIA THE CREATE IMPORT SHIPMENT FEATURE ON FEDEX.COM, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE GIVEN TO FEDEX, THE PARTY THAT INITIATES THE IMPORT SHIPMENT TRANSACTION WITH FEDEX IS ULTIMATELY LIABLE FOR, WILL BE BILLED FOR, AND AGREES TO PAY, ALL CHARGES AND FEES, INCLUDING ANY SPECIAL HANDLING FEES AND ANY DUTIES OR TAXES WHICH WE HAVE ADVANCED, REGARDLESS OF ANY PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CONTRARY, IF THE SENDER OR THIRD PARTY FAILS OR REFUSES TO PAY.</p>
<p>J.     <b>Shipper Warranty.</b> The shipper warrants that each article in each shipment will possess the required paperwork to export, will be properly described on the Commercial Invoice, will be acceptable for transport by FedEx Ground, and will be properly marked, addressed and packaged to ensure safe transportation with ordinary care in handling.</p>
<p>K.    <b>Undeliverable Shipments.</b> The shipper may elect to have a shipment returned if the shipment is refused by the consignee or for any other reason cannot be delivered. If a shipment is returned to the shipper, the shipper is responsible for payment of both the original transportation charges and the return charges. All duties and taxes, assessed in the destination country as well as the origin country upon return, are also the responsibility of the shipper. All return charges are payable immediately upon request.<br />
<br />
A shipper may elect to &quot;abandon&quot; the shipment in the destination country. If a shipment is abandoned, FedEx Ground, at its discretion, reserves the right to dispose of the merchandise. The shipper will be responsible for any charges associated with disposal.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>Account-Specific Rates will not apply unless charged to a valid FedEx account. FedEx account holders who pay for shipments originating in the U.S. with a credit card instead of charging to a valid FedEx account will be charged Standard List Rates. <br />
<br />
Account numbers are issued by FedEx according to shipping location and are nontransferable. Account numbers are issued and used solely at the discretion of FedEx. FedEx may discontinue the use of accounts, in whole or in part, and terminate all or particular accounts and account numbers at any time, for any reason, at its sole discretion. Improper, illegal or any other misuse of your FedEx account may also, at the sole discretion of FedEx, result in loss of discounts or termination of the account. Improper, illegal or other misuse includes, but is not limited to, unauthorized consolidation of shipments owned by different parties, or violations of the terms and conditions in this FedEx Service Guide. If your account has been compromised or stolen, the account may be closed and you may be issued a new account. However, you will be responsible for all valid charges on the closed account. Any materials, rights or privileges that you acquire by holding a FedEx account number may not be used for any purpose other than shipping with FedEx, and FedEx may seek damages against you for any improper, illegal or other misuse of your account. If your account is terminated, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to deny your application for new or additional FedEx account numbers at any time in the future. All charges will be billed and must be remitted in U.S. funds.<br />
<br />
Any individual or entity that uses the FedEx account or shipping discounts of another FedEx account holder without authorization will be charged Standard List Rates for all such shipments without prior notice. This includes all shipments, whether they are classified as “Bill Sender,” “Bill Recipient” or “Bill Third Party,” or any other method of billing. Unauthorized use includes, but is not limited to, using the shipping discount of another FedEx account holder without the knowledge and permission of both FedEx and the account holder.<br />
<br />
All requests for account numbers are subject to credit investigation and verification by our Credit Department and Customer Account Confirmation Department. FedEx utilizes business credit reporting agencies, audited financial statements, Standard &amp; Poor’s and Moody’s bond ratings, and other sources as necessary, to determine eligibility for open credit terms. FedEx does not offer consumer credit privileges. Any individual shipping for personal use must prepay the shipment charges or establish a FedEx account for billing directly to a major credit card. Stored-value cards or gift cards cannot be used to open an account; however, such cards may be used for payment when tendering a shipment at staffed FedEx shipping locations, and in conjunction with our credit card acceptance policy. If your FedEx account is billed directly to a credit card, you agree to the following terms: (1) you authorize FedEx to initiate variable charges to the credit card to settle charges payable to FedEx; (2) you authorize FedEx to charge your card for any unpaid amounts on your account; (3) you authorize the card issuer to pay any amounts associated with your account without requiring a signed receipt; (4) you agree to keep your card information current (FedEx may receive updates on your card information from participating issuing banks and may update your account profile to avoid service disruptions); (5) you agree that FedEx shall have no liability for any insufficient funds or other charges incurred from attempts to charge and/or place holds on your card; and (6) your agreement to these terms and conditions is to be accepted as authorization to the card issuer to pay all amounts associated with your account.<br />
<br />
The party to whom a FedEx account number is issued is liable for all charges to the account, including those resulting from unauthorized use. The account holder is responsible for the safekeeping of the account number. The account number should be released only to those authorized to ship on the account. <br />
<br />
Failure to keep your FedEx account current may result in “termination” of your FedEx SameDay City service. If the account number to be billed is not valid, the shipment may be refused, delayed or returned until an alternative form of payment is secured. If a shipment is held, returned, or delivery is otherwise delayed because the account is not in good credit standing, you will not be entitled to a refund or credit of your transportation charges under the money-back guarantee policy.<br />
<br />
You must use your FedEx account number to obtain any discount applicable to your account. Use of your account number constitutes your agreement that all shipments shipped by us shall be subject to this tariff, as modified, amended or supplemented.<br />
<br />
For FedEx SameDay City services, you may only request FedEx to bill accounts with a U.S. or Canadian billing address. Any request for FedEx to bill otherwise is null and void, and FedEx, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to bill the sender for those charges.<br />
<br />
FedEx may provide trade credit information on its account holders to credit bureaus.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE GIVEN TO FEDEX, OR ANY PROVISION OF THIS TARIFF CONTEMPLATING INVOICING OF OR PAYMENT BY A THIRD PARTY, THE SENDER IS ULTIMATELY LIABLE FOR ANY AND ALL CHARGES AND FEES.</p>
<p>B.    “Bill Sender” means charges will be billed to the sender. Payment on the account must be current. The sender may request an initial rebilling to another party, but all subsequent rebills will be only to the sender, and the sender will remain ultimately responsible for payment of all such charges not paid by such other party during the applicable invoice period.</p>
<p>C.    “Bill Third Party’s FedEx Account Number” means charges will be billed to someone other than the sender or recipient (except for certain additional charges that are billed to the sender, including, but not limited to, weekly pickup fees, alternate address pickup fees, on-call per-package pickup charges, address correction fees, and invalid or missing account number fees). In order to choose this billing option, the FedEx account number of the third party must be inputted into the sender’s electronic shipping system at the time the shipment is processed and payment on the account must be current. If the third party is billed initially and refuses to make payment for the shipment, the charges may be rebilled to another party, but subsequent requests will only be rebilled to the sender. (See section K, Billing Special Handling Fees.) If the party that is rebilled refuses or fails to pay in the applicable invoice period, the sender is liable for and will be billed for all charges and fees, plus all special handling fees. If due to the charges the third-party account exceeds credit limits with FedEx, the sender will automatically be billed.</p>
<p>D.    For “Bill Third Party” transactions, if the third party refuses to pay the charges, refuses delivery, fails to pay within the applicable invoice period, or cannot be contacted, the sender is responsible and will be billed for any and all charges. For “Bill Third Party” transactions, we may verify the method of payment and reserve the right to not accept any “Bill Third Party” shipment for which such verification cannot be established.</p>
<p>E.    FedEx may consider payment type in determining pricing and discounts, and reserves the right to adjust discounts based on payment type.</p>
<p>F.    The sender’s shipment may be delayed if we determine that it is billed to a FedEx account number that is not in good credit standing. The service failure money-back guarantee will not apply (see the Money-Back Guarantee Policy section for details and limitations).</p>
<p>G.    A special handling fee will be applied for any check or electronic funds transfer (EFT) that is dishonored due to insufficient funds on deposit or incorrect or insufficient signature of the drawer.</p>
<p>H.   Your payment must be accompanied by the remittance data that supports the payment. Remittance data must include the FedEx invoice number and the associated amount(s) being paid on the FedEx invoice. Payment at the tracking-number level must be transmitted to FedEx via electronic data interchange (EDI) — see the EDI section below.</p>
<p>Payment should be sent using your remittance advice to one of the following:</p>
<p>(By FedEx Envelope)<br />
FedEx Lockbox 360353<br />
Room 154-0455<br />
500 Ross Street<br />
Pittsburgh, PA 15262<br />
<br />
(By U.S. Postal Service)<br />
Any customer not using electronic data interchange (EDI) or FedEx Billing Online should mail payment and remittance detail to:<br />
FedEx <br />
P.O. Box 371461<br />
Pittsburgh, PA 15250-7461<br />
<br />
Customers who receive their invoices via FedEx Billing Online should mail their payment and remittance detail to:<br />
FedEx Billing Online<br />
P.O. Box 371599<br />
Pittsburgh, PA 15250-7599</p>
<p>I.      If you receive invoices via EDI, your payment must be accompanied by electronic remittance data that includes the associated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bill-to account number(s).</li>
<li>Invoice number(s).</li>
<li>Tracking number(s).</li>
<li>Amount(s) being paid.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about EDI remittance, refer to the FedEx EDI Invoicing and Remittance Overview guide at fedex.com/en-us/billing-online.html#electronic-data-interchange. Some invoice adjustment requests may also be transmitted electronically.</p>
<p>Payment for EDI invoices must be submitted electronically via electronic funds transfer (EFT) or by sending a check payment to one of the following:<br />

<p>J.     If you are interested in or have questions regarding any of our invoicing or payment methods, contact your FedEx account executive or call FedEx SameDay Services at <a href="tel:18003995999">1.800.399.5999</a> (option 4).</p>
<p>K.    <b>Billing Special Handling Fees.</b> A special handling fee will be applied in the following situations:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     Invoicing where an incomplete, inaccurate, invalid or deleted account number appears in the EDI transmission of shipping information.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">a.      For “Bill Sender” transactions, if the account number on the shipping barcode is incomplete, inaccurate, invalid or deleted, and we are able to determine the correct number from our records, all charges and fees, plus the special handling fee, will be billed to the sender. If the correct account number cannot be determined from our records, all charges and fees plus the special handling fee will be billed to the sender.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">b.      For “Bill Third Party” transactions, if the third party account number in the electronic data interchange (EDI) transmission is incomplete, inaccurate, invalid or deleted, all charges and fees, plus the special handling fee, will be billed to the sender. If we can determine the sender’s correct account number from our records, it will be used for billing.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">c.      The fee for an incomplete, inaccurate, invalid or deleted account number will be applied only once for each package with such an account number.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     Payer Rebilling. A special handling fee will be charged to the sender for all requests to change a billing from the party billed or the bill-to party shown on the shipping transmission, which fee may be applied to each invoice line item which is rebilled. Requests for rebilling will be accepted up to 180 days from the invoice date, not counting the invoice date.<br />
<br />
Requests for rebilling of transportation charges must be received via one of the approved channels:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">a.      Submit your request through the Non-Pay option with Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) if you are a registered user; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">b.      Call customer service at <a href="tel:18003995999">1.800.399.5999</a> and select the billing prompt.</p>
<p>L.     <b>  Invoice Adjustments/Overcharges:</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     We reserve the right to audit shipments, including those submitted via an electronic shipping device, to verify service selection and package or shipment weight. If the service selected or weight entered is incorrect, we may make appropriate adjustments to the invoice at any time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     Default Billing. Senders are responsible for provision of complete and accurate shipment information, including entry in any electronic shipping device. Because the number of packages and weight per package are critical to our ability to correctly invoice, any omission or incorrect entry or unavailable information will result in a billing based on our estimate of the number of packages transported and either the standard dimensional factor at the time of billing or a standard “default” weight-per-package estimate determined at our sole discretion.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     You may request an invoice adjustment for reasons not related to a service failure by calling <a href="tel:18003995999">1.800.399.5999</a> (select option 4, then option 1 to leave a voice message or option 2 to speak with a live agent). If you choose to submit your request via the telephone invoice adjustment system, the request must state the reason you believe an adjustment or refund is warranted and must provide the following: the FedEx account number (if any); the FedEx tracking number; and the date of shipment. All requests for adjustments must be made by an agent of the billed account.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">A partial payment against an invoice is not considered a request for invoice adjustment or notice of a refund request.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     Requests for invoice adjustment due to an overcharge (including unidentified payments and duplicate payments) must be received within 60 days after the date of shipment. For adjustments due to a service failure, see the Money-Back Guarantee Policy section.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">For additional information or assistance regarding billing issues, please contact a FedEx account executive.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.     FedEx is not obligated to refund any overcharge or pay any other obligation owed when your FedEx account is, or has been in the past, more than 60 days past due.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.     If your account is more than 60 days past due, FedEx may, at its sole discretion, apply any overcharge amounts or other overpayments it agrees are owed to you against the oldest invoices.</p>
<p>M.   <b>Additional Taxes.</b> If any value-added, consumption or similar tax is applicable to your shipment, we reserve the right to add that amount to your shipment charges.</p>
<p>N.    The sender is responsible for all reasonable costs incurred by FedEx in attempting to obtain payment on any transaction. Such costs include, but are not limited to, attorneys’ fees, collection agency fees, and interest and court costs.</p>
<p>O.    At our sole discretion, FedEx may transfer and assign ownership of, and any rights to collect, any and all charges due and payable to us.</p>
<p>P.    <b>Missing or Invalid Account Number.</b> An account number is invalid if it is not the correct account number for the bill-to party, or it is the account number for a third party who fails to pay the shipping charges. An additional charge will be assessed for each missing or invalid account number.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    <b>Filing of Claims:</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     With respect to any alleged or actual loss, damage, delay, misdelivery or nondelivery with respect to any shipment, a claim must be filed in accordance with the provisions of this item as a condition precedent to any liability of FedEx and any recovery by the claimant. FedEx liability with respect to any such claim, if any, shall be governed by the provisions of this tariff. Claims must be filed by the beneficial owner of the shipment, and by filing, the claimant warrants and represents that it is the owner of the goods in question.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     All claims must be submitted on forms made available by FedEx, or otherwise contain information required by FedEx. FedEx shall have no obligation to consider or to pay any claim that does not conform to FedEx requirements. You can file a claim in the following ways:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">a.      Submit claims through email at billing@fedexsameday.com.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">b.      Send written claims, including the completed claim form and supporting documentation, via the U.S. Postal Service or fax to: <br />
FedEx SameDay Service<br />
Attn: Claims Specialist <br />
3469 Dearborn Plaza <br />
Hapeville, GA 30354<br />
Fax: <b>1.404.305.1523</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">c.      Call customer service at <a href="tel:18003995999">1.800.399.5999</a> to obtain steps to submit a case number for your claim, then complete a print copy of the claim form. You may have to submit supporting documentation using the mailing address or fax number listed above.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     FedEx will not voluntarily pay a claim for an uncertain amount, such as “$100 more or less.” We are not obligated to act on any claim until all transportation charges are paid. The claim amount may not be deducted from these charges or any outstanding balance.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     Bad order reports, appraisal reports of damage, notations of exceptions on delivery records or other documents, inspection reports issued by our inspectors or inspection agencies, requests for proof of delivery, and tracer or inspection requests standing alone are not sufficient to comply with these claim filing requirements.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.     FedEx SameDay City shipment-status information is not intended or permitted to be used by the shipper to file claims.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.     FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THE ABOVE CONDITIONS WILL RESULT IN THE DENIAL OF A CLAIM.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">7.     Upon payment of a claim, FedEx may, in its sole discretion, elect to take title to, and salvage, any goods with respect to which payment has been made. By accepting payment, the claimant warrants and represents that it will transfer title of such goods to FedEx upon request, and waives any and all claims arising from or related to any such salvage.</p>
<p>B.    <b>Acknowledgment of Claims.</b> FedEx will, upon receipt in writing of a proper claim filed in the manner and form described in this tariff and accompanied by the documents required or requested by FedEx, acknowledge the receipt of such claim in writing within 30 days after the date of receipt by FedEx unless FedEx shall have paid or declined such claim in writing within 30 days of the receipt thereof. FedEx will create either in writing or electronically a separate file for each claim received, assign each claim a successive claim file number, and note the claim number assigned on all documents filed in support of the claim and all records and correspondence relating to the claim, including the written acknowledgment of receipt and, if in its possession, the pickup and delivery records covering the shipment involved. FedEx will record the date a claim is received on the face of the claim document. The date of receipt will also be noted on our written acknowledgment of receipt.</p>
<p>C.    <b>Time Limit for Filing Claims.</b> Claims for loss, damage or delay must be filed in writing with FedEx within nine months from the date of delivery, or, in the event that FedEx failed to make delivery, within nine months after the shipment was tendered to FedEx for shipment. Suits against FedEx must be instituted within two years and one day from the date FedEx gives written notice that FedEx has disallowed any part of the claim specified in the notice. If claims are not filed or suits are not instituted in accordance with the foregoing provisions, FedEx will not be liable and such claims will not be paid. A Claim Reporting Form can be requested from a FedEx account representative or by calling <a href="tel:18003995999">1.800.399.5999</a>.</p>
<p>D.    <b>Investigation of Claims:</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     Each claim must be supported by the original Customer Shipping Record (if applicable), evidence that applicable transportation charges have been paid, and documents that prove the value of the property, and/or extent of the loss or damage. Such documents may include original purchase invoices, estimates or invoices for repair, expense statements, appraisals, pictures of the damage and inside and outside packaging, or other certified documents. The documents must be verifiable to our satisfaction. Where the property involved in a claim has not been invoiced to the recipient, or where an invoice does not show price or value, or where the property involved has not been sold, or where the property has been transferred at bookkeeping values only, FedEx will, before voluntarily paying a claim thereon, require the claimant to establish the destination value of the quantity shipped, transported or involved, and to certify the correctness of the valuations in writing.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     When a claim for loss of an entire package or an entire shipment cannot otherwise be authenticated upon investigation, FedEx will obtain from the recipient of the shipment involved a certified statement in writing that the property for which the claim is filed has not been received from any other source.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     In the event that the shipper and the recipient have refused a package, the property shall thereupon pass to FedEx. FedEx will not honor a claim for an abandoned package.</p>
<p>E.    <b>Disposition of Claims.</b> FedEx will, after receiving a written claim for loss or damage to the property transported, either pay actual or declared value for the property, whichever is lower; or decline, or make a firm compromise settlement offer in writing to the sender (unless special arrangements have been made) within 120 days after receipt of claim by FedEx. If a claim cannot be processed and disposed of within 120 days after the receipt thereof, FedEx will advise in writing of the status of the claim and the reason for the delay in making final disposition. Acceptance of payment of a claim shall extinguish any right to recover in connection with that shipment.</p>
<p>F.    <b>  Damaged Property:</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     FedEx Discovered Damage. Whenever property is damaged by FedEx in the course of transportation and discovered by FedEx prior to delivery, FedEx will either (1) return the damaged property to the shipper or (2) remove any damaged property and ship the balance of undamaged merchandise.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     Concealed Loss or Damage. Whenever property is delivered by FedEx and damage or loss that was not evident upon reasonable inspection at the time of delivery is not noted at the time of delivery, if the shipper or recipient notify FedEx of the damage or shortage within 5 days of the date of delivery, then FedEx will process the claim as if the damage or shortage had been noted by the recipient at the time of delivery.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     FedEx reserves the right to inspect a damaged shipment on customer premises as well as the right to retrieve the damaged shipment for inspection at a local FedEx facility. All of the original shipping cartons, packing and contents must be available for our inspection and retained until the claim is concluded. Inspection will include examination of the damaged property, the shipping container and its packing, and any other action necessary to establish all the facts. If a shortage is involved, the inspector will compare the contents of the shipment with the invoice, weigh the shipping container and contents, or conduct any other type of investigation necessary to establish that a loss has occurred. In either case, the inspection will be limited to a factual report. The shipper and recipient must cooperate with FedEx to assist in the inspection. A written record of our findings will be made and a copy given to the shipper for claim support upon request. Any inspection report issued will be incorporated into the claim file.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     In the event FedEx does not make an inspection, the recipient must make the inspection and record all information pertinent to the cause. The recipient’s inspection, in such case, may be considered as the FedEx inspection and will not jeopardize any recovery due the shipper based on the facts contained in the report.</p>
<p>G.    The claimant, and any other party with an interest in the shipment, shall exercise reasonable care in mitigating damages arising from or related to any claim of loss, damage, delay, misdelivery or nondelivery with respect to any package.</p>

<p>E.    The invoice date begins the credit term cycle, and payment in full and without offset is due within 15 days from the invoice date. Failure to keep your FedEx account current will result in your account being placed on cash-only status. This status may impair your ability to use our services, delay your shipments, and may result in the loss of any applicable discounts.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    If FedEx is liable for loss, damage, delay or misdelivery arising from or related to loss or damage to shipments in accordance with the provisions of this tariff, FedEx liability is limited to the sum of $100 per shipment unless a higher value is declared at time of tender and a greater charge paid as provided in the FedEx Service Guide.</p>
<p>B.    The declared value of any shipment represents our maximum liability in connection with a shipment, including, but not limited to, any loss, damage, delay, misdelivery, nondelivery, misinformation, any failure to provide information or misdelivery of information. Exposure to and risk of any loss in excess of the declared value is either assumed by the owner or transferred by the owner to an insurance carrier through the purchase of an insurance policy. The shipper should contact an insurance agent or broker if insurance coverage is desired. FEDEX DOES NOT PROVIDE INSURANCE COVERAGE OF ANY KIND.</p>
<p>C.    In cases where the shipper declares or agrees in writing that the property being shipped is released to a value exceeding $100 per shipment or article not enclosed in a shipment, an additional charge for each $100 or fraction thereof of total valuation will be assessed to which the base rate applies, up to a maximum declared value of $2,000 per shipment.</p>
<p>D.    The foregoing notwithstanding, shipments containing all or part of the following items are limited to a maximum declared value of $1,000:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     Artwork, including any work created or developed by the application of skill, taste or creative talent for sale, display or collection. This includes, but is not limited to, items (and their parts) such as paintings, drawings, vases, tapestries, limited-edition prints, fine art, statuary, sculpture and collector’s items.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     Film, photographic images (including photographic negatives), photographic chromes and photographic slides.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     Any commodity that by its inherent nature is particularly susceptible to damage or the market value of which is particularly variable or difficult to ascertain.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     Antiques, or any commodity that exhibits the style or fashion of a past era and whose history, age or rarity contributes to its value. These items include, but are not limited to, furniture, tableware and glassware.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.     Collector’s items such as coins, stamps, sports cards, souvenirs and memorabilia.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.     Glassware, including, but not limited to, signs, mirrors, ceramics, porcelains, china, crystal, glass, framed glass and any other commodity with similarly fragile qualities.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">7.     Plasma screens or any device which includes a plasma screen.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">8.     Jewelry, including, but not limited to, costume jewelry, watches and their parts, mount gems or stones (precious or semiprecious), industrial diamonds, and jewelry made of precious metal.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">9.     Furs, including, but not limited to, fur clothing, fur-trimmed clothing and fur pelts.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">10.  Precious metals, including, but not limited to, gold and silver bullion or dust, precipitates or platinum (except as an integral part of electronic machinery).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">11.  Stocks, bonds, cash letters or cash equivalents, including, but not limited to, food stamps, postage stamps (not collectible), traveler’s checks, lottery tickets, money orders, gift cards and gift certificates, prepaid calling cards (excluding those that require a code for activation), bond coupons, and bearer bonds.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">12.  Musical instruments that are more than 20 years old, or any customized or personalized musical instruments.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">13.  Scale models (including, but not limited to, architectural models and dollhouses) and prototypes.</p>
<p>E.    ANY EFFORT TO DECLARE A VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE MAXIMUMS ALLOWED IN THIS TARIFF IS NULL AND VOID. OUR ACCEPTANCE FOR CARRIAGE OF ANY SHIPMENT BEARING A DECLARED VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE ALLOWED MAXIMUMS DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF ANY PROVISION OF THE FEDEX SERVICE GUIDE AS TO SUCH SHIPMENT.</p>
<p>F.    REGARDLESS OF THE DECLARED VALUE OF A SHIPMENT, OUR LIABILITY FOR LOSS, DAMAGE, DELAY, MISDELIVERY, NONDELIVERY, MISINFORMATION, ANY FAILURE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION, OR MISDELIVERY OF INFORMATION, WILL NOT EXCEED ITS REPAIR COST, ITS DEPRECIATED VALUE OR ITS REPLACEMENT COST, WHICHEVER IS LESS.</p>
<p>G.    See the Liabilities Not Assumed section for other limitations and exclusions on our liability.</p>
<p>H.    With respect to any device or media upon or within which data or other information (whether in print or electronic form) is maintained, the value of such device or media is limited to the cost to repair or replace such device or media without consideration for the data or other information contained therein or set forth thereon. By tendering any such device or media, the party making such tender acknowledges and agrees that back-up copies of any and all data or information contained therein or set forth thereon are being maintained and can be readily reproduced.</p>

<p>A.    <b>Indirect Signature Required.</b> FedEx will obtain a signature in one of two ways: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     From someone at the delivery address; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     From a neighbor, building manager or other person at a neighboring address.</p>
<p>B.    <b>Direct Signature Required.</b> FedEx will obtain a signature from someone at the delivery address. If no one is at the address, FedEx will reattempt delivery the following business day unless marked return to sender.</p>
<p>C.    <b>Adult Signature Required.</b> FedEx will obtain a signature from someone at least 21 years old (government-issued photo identification required) at the delivery address. If no eligible recipient is at the address, FedEx will reattempt delivery the following business day unless marked return to sender.</p>
<p>D.    Shipments to residential addresses may be released without obtaining a signature. If you require a signature for a residential shipment, select one of the Delivery Signature Options.</p>
<p>E.    Indirect Signature Required is not available for shipments to nonresidential addresses.</p>
<p>F.    FedEx may accept requests for address corrections from a shipper or a recipient for shipments involving the Direct Signature Required or Indirect Signature Required options, and shipments where no signature is required.</p>
<p>G.    FedEx will assess the delivery signature charge if the shipper requests the Delivery Signature Option, even if a signature is not obtained, the option requested is not available or FedEx is unable to provide a copy of the signature obtained at delivery.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    Hazardous materials, except as specified in this section, are prohibited. Please see the Prohibited Items section.</p>
<p>B.    FedEx accepts only certain hazardous materials. Contact a FedEx account executive, see fedex.com/hazardousmaterials or call <a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a> and say &quot;hazardous materials&quot; for more information. Specifically, FedEx accepts only dry ice and Category B (UN 3373) hazardous materials for shipment.</p>
<p>C.    Permissible shipments must be properly classified, described, packaged, marked, labeled and in proper condition for transportation according to applicable laws, rules and regulations and FedEx SameDay City requirements.</p>
<p>D.    In no event will any waste material (including any hazardous waste or any material intended to be recycled), any material regulated as an inhalation hazard, or any material defined as a &quot;hazardous substance&quot; be tendered to FedEx for transportation. This includes, but is not limited to, used hypodermic needles or syringes transported for sterilization, recycling, disposal or for any other purpose, or other medical waste.</p>
<p>E.    With the exception of Category B (UN 3373) shipments, FedEx does not accept, and you agree not to tender, any infectious human or animal cells, tissue, bodily fluids, blood, blood products, plasma, or any other material derived from human or animal blood whether in liquid or solid form; biohazards; regulated or non-regulated diagnostic cultures, specimens or samples, whether infectious or non-infectious; used health care products as defined in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations; and any materials regulated as UN 2814, UN 2900, and UN 3291.</p>
<p>F.    Shippers who tender Category B (UN 3373) shipments must comply with all applicable local, state and federal laws governing packing, marking and labeling of shipments of blood and blood products, regardless of whether they are infectious. The shipper assumes sole responsibility for compliance with all applicable governmental regulations. For more information on FedEx guidelines, go to fedex.com/packaging and read our brochures on packaging clinical samples and Biological Substance, UN 3373 specimens.</p>
<p>G.    Shipments containing hazardous materials cannot be banded, strapped or taped to form a bundle.</p>
<p>H.    All shipments containing dry ice require shipment marking and labeling. For additional information on proper packing or labeling call <a href="tel:18004633339">1.800.463.3339</a> and say &quot;hazardous materials.&quot;</p>
<p>I.      Batteries, including lithium batteries, may be regulated when shipped for highway transport. Shippers should refer to the most current U.S. Department of Transportation regulations to ensure compliance with marking, labeling and packaging requirements as they pertain to the transportation of batteries. For details, go to fedex.com and enter keyword &quot;lithium batteries.&quot; FedEx does not accept waste batteries or batteries being shipped for recycling or disposal, including damaged or defective batteries.</p>
<p>J.     We have the right to refuse any shipment with an odor or any shipment that is wet or leaking. If a shipment damages or contaminates any property, the shipper is solely responsible for and will reimburse and indemnify FedEx for any and all costs, fees and expenses it incurs in connection with the cleanup of such damage or contamination.</p>
<p>K.    Hazardous material shipments found in the FedEx SameDay City system not properly prepared in accordance with DOT regulations and FedEx SameDay City requirements will be returned to the originating pickup location. If the shipper refuses return of the shipment, the shipper will reimburse FedEx for all costs and fees of any type connected with the legal disposal of the shipment. The shipper agrees to indemnify FedEx for any and all costs, fees and expenses FedEx incurs as a result of the shipper’s failure to comply with FedEx hazardous materials shipping requirements.</p>
<p>L.     Hazardous materials may not be rerouted to an address other than the original intended-recipient’s address provided by the shipper.</p>
<p>M.   Shipments containing hazardous materials are not eligible for signature release, driver release or indirect delivery.</p>

<br />
IN NO EVENT SHALL FEDEX, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, AGENTS, CONTRACTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AFFILIATES, BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS OR INCOME, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR CLAIMS INVOLVING ACTUAL OR ALLEGED THEFT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF IDENTITY, WHETHER OR NOT FEDEX HAD KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH DAMAGES MIGHT BE INCURRED.<br />
<br />
THE SOLE LIABILITY OF FEDEX, AND THE SOLE RECOVERY OF ANY CLAIM, WITH RESPECT TO ANY LOSS, DAMAGE, DELAY, MISDELIVERY, NONDELIVERY, MISINFORMATION OR ANY FAILURE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION, SHALL BE AS SET FORTH IN, AND PURSUANT TO, THIS TARIFF. Without in any way limiting the foregoing, FedEx will not be liable for, nor shall any adjustment, refund or credit of any kind be given as a result of, any loss, damage, delay, misdelivery, nondelivery, misinformation or failure to provide information caused by or resulting in whole or in part from:</p>

<p>5.     Damage or loss of articles packaged and sealed by the sender or by person(s) acting at the sender’s direction, provided the seal is unbroken at the time of delivery, the shipment retains its basic integrity, and the recipient accepts the shipment without noting the damage on the delivery record.</p>
<p>6.     Erasure of information or data, or loss or irretrievability of information or data, including but not limited to information or data stored on magnetic tapes, files or other storage media, or erasure or damage of photographic images or soundtracks.</p>
<p>7.     The loss of any personal or financial information including, but not limited to, social security numbers, dates of birth, driver’s license numbers, credit card numbers and financial account information.</p>
<p>8.     Our inability to provide a copy of the delivery record or a copy of the signature obtained at delivery.</p>
<p>9.     Failing to deliver or to meet our delivery commitment for any shipments with an incomplete or incorrect address. (See the Undeliverable Shipments section.)</p>

<p>11.  Failing to obtain the signature option requested for shipments using FedEx Delivery Signature Options. (See the Delivery Signature Options section.)</p>
<p>12.  Shipments released without obtaining a signature at residential addresses. (See the Delivery Signature Options and Pickup and Delivery sections.)</p>

<p>14.  Our failure to honor package-orientation graphics (e.g., “up” arrows, “this end up” markings), “fragile” labels or other special directions concerning packages.</p>
<p>15.  Damages indicated by any shockwatch, tiltmeter or temperature instruments.</p>
<p>16.  Your failure to ship goods in packaging approved by us prior to shipment where such prior approval is recommended or required.</p>
<p>17.  Your use of an incomplete, inaccurate, or invalid FedEx account number or your failure to provide a valid FedEx account number in good credit standing in the billing instructions on shipping documentation.</p>
<p>18.  Our failure to notify you of any delay, loss or damage in connection with your shipment or any inaccuracy in such notice.</p>

<p>21.  The shipper’s failure to delete all shipments entered into a FedEx self-invoicing system, internet shipping device or any other electronic shipping method used to ship a package, when the shipment is not tendered to FedEx. If you fail to do so and seek a refund, credit or invoice adjustment, you must comply with the notice provisions in Invoice Adjustments/Overcharges in the Billing section. FedEx is not liable for any refund, credit or adjustment unless you comply with those notice provisions.</p>
<p>22.  Shipments of any plants and plant materials, ostrich or emu eggs, or live fish.</p>
<p>23.  Damage to computers, or any components thereof, or any electronic equipment when shipped in any packaging other than:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">b.     Packaging that is in accordance with the FedEx packaging guidelines available online at fedex.com/packaging.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">c.     FedEx laptop packaging, for shipments of laptop computers.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">e.     FedEx tablet packaging, for shipments of tablet computers.</p>
<p>24.  Packaging of a shipment, including failure to comply with the provisions of this tariff regarding packaging, or our provision of packaging, advice, assistance or guidance on the appropriate packaging of shipments unless such advice, assistance or guidance has been approved in writing by FedEx Packaging Design and Development and the writing expressly accepts liability in the event of a damaged shipment. FedEx reserves the right to request a shipper to submit a representative sampling of the packaging for inspection and testing. If the shipper fails to comply with our request to inspect and test the packaging, or the sampling fails FedEx testing, FedEx will not be liable for any damages due to improper packaging. FedEx may issue written notice to you if you repeatedly fail to adhere to FedEx packaging requirements due to your pattern or practice of insufficient packaging. Claims for damage or loss associated with an identified pattern or practice of insufficient packaging will be denied. Any such claim filed related to your shipments will not be paid, regardless of which party files the claim, unless the claimant can establish that the loss or damage did not result from a failure to use proper packaging. FedEx will continue to deny such claims until we determine that you have ceased the pattern or practice of failing to adhere to the packaging requirements. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to limit FedEx’s right to deny a claim where the shipment in dispute is found to have improper packaging. At the sole discretion of FedEx, FedEx may require a shipper of packages classified as Oversize, as defined in the Rates section of the FedEx Service Guide, to submit a representative sampling of the oversize packaging for inspection and testing. If the shipper fails to comply with our request to inspect and test oversize packaging or the sampling fails FedEx testing, FedEx will not be liable for any damage to shipper’s oversize packages.</p>
<p>25.  FedEx does not provide protective services for transportation of perishable commodities or of commodities requiring protection from heat or cold. Such commodities will be accepted for transportation solely at the shipper’s risk for loss of value or damage occasioned by exposure to heat or cold, or the inherent vice of such perishable commodities. Shipments containing perishable articles must be packaged for a minimum transit time of at least 12 hours greater than the shipment’s delivery commitment time.</p>
<p>26.  The failure to provide any services or service options where our records do not reflect that the services or service options were selected by the shipper.</p>
<p>27.  Our compliance or noncompliance with verbal or written delivery instructions from the sender, recipient or persons claiming to represent the shipper or recipient, including requests made by the recipient for delivery options using FedEx Delivery Manager.</p>
<p>28.  Our compliance or noncompliance with any request to intercept a shipment in transit, or to prevent delivery.</p>
<p>29.  The failure to properly designate a delivery address as a Residential Delivery or Commercial Delivery, including delivery addresses that were processed through any address verification function or program.</p>
<p>30.  The shipper’s failure to provide accurate delivery address information.</p>
<p>31.  Any shipment containing a prohibited item. (See the Prohibited Items section.)</p>
<p>32.  Our inability or failure to complete a delivery, or a delay to any delivery, due to acts or omissions of regulatory agencies.</p>
<p>33.  Delays in delivery caused by adherence to FedEx policies regarding the payment of duties and taxes or other charges.</p>
<p>34.  Our failure or inability to attempt to contact the sender or recipient concerning an incomplete or inaccurate address; incorrect, incomplete, inaccurate or missing documentation; payment of duties and taxes necessary to release a shipment; or an incomplete or incorrect customs broker’s address.</p>
<p>35.  Hazardous-materials shipments that the shipper did not properly declare, including proper documentation, markings, labels and packaging. FedEx will not pay a claim on undeclared or hidden hazardous materials and the FedEx Money-Back Guarantee does not apply.</p>
<p>Your use of FedEx customer automation systems or software versions that are no longer supported by FedEx, or your failure to update or upgrade FedEx customer automation hardware or software as provided or directed by FedEx from time to time.<br />

Any legal proceeding arising from or related to any loss, damage, delay, misdelivery, nondelivery, misinformation, any failure to provide information, or misdelivery of information relating to the shipment, must be brought within two years and one day from the date FedEx gives written notice that FedEx has disallowed any part of the claim specified in the notice.<br />
<br />
Any right you might have to damages, refunds, credits, recovery of reliance interests, disgorgement, restitution, injunctive relief, declaratory relief or any other legal or equitable relief whatsoever against FedEx under any cause of action arising from the transportation of any shipment pursuant to the FedEx Service Guide shall be extinguished unless you first comply with all applicable notice periods and requirements in this tariff including, but not limited to, the periods and requirements for providing notice under the Billing, Claims and Money-Back Guarantee Policy sections. You and FedEx understand that timely and complete compliance with such notice periods and requirements is a contractual condition precedent to your right to any relief whatsoever, and you must plead compliance with those conditions precedent on the face of any complaint that you file against FedEx. You and FedEx agree that FedEx cannot be considered to have breached any obligation to you unless or until FedEx wrongfully denies a claim submitted to FedEx pursuant to the notice periods and requirements contained in this tariff. Finally, you and FedEx agree that you will comply with applicable notice periods and requirements even if you believe that such compliance will not result in relief from FedEx or if you lack knowledge regarding whether such compliance will result in relief from FedEx.<br />

You agree that you will not sue FedEx as a class plaintiff or class representative, join as a class member, or participate as an adverse party in any way in a class-action lawsuit against FedEx. Nothing in this paragraph, however, limits your rights to bring a lawsuit as an individual plaintiff.<br />

To the extent that any court finds that state rather than federal law applies to any provision of this contract, the controlling law is the substantive law of the state in which you tendered your shipment to FedEx. To the extent there is a conflict between the provisions of this tariff and any rights or remedies contained in Part B of Subtitle IV to Title 49 of the U.S. Code, the provisions of this tariff shall govern.<br />
<br />
The performance of any services does not make FedEx an agent of the shipper or any third party for any purpose.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>Subject to the provisions of this tariff limiting shipper’s right thereto, we offer a money-back guarantee for our services. This guarantee can be suspended, modified or revoked at our sole discretion without prior notice to you.</p>
<p>A.    <b>Money-Back Guarantee.</b> At our option, we will, upon request, either refund or credit your transportation charges in the event of a service failure (which means delivery of your shipment 60 seconds or more after the published delivery commitment time for the selected service and destination, except as otherwise described in these terms and conditions). This money-back guarantee is your exclusive remedy in the event of a service failure for the recovery of all or any portion of the FedEx charges for a shipment. If the money-back guarantee is suspended, there is no remedy or recovery of charges for a service failure. There are no delivery commitments for shipments on which the money-back guarantee is suspended.</p>
<p>B.    <b>Limitations.</b> The following limitations apply to any refund or credit related to a service failure: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     A credit or refund under the money-back guarantee will be applied only against charges for the shipment giving rise to the credit.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     At the sole discretion of FedEx, the money-back guarantee may not be honored when the request is made by, or the information utilized to determine the status of the shipment is determined by, a third party other than the payer of the charges.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     The FedEx SameDay City Money-Back Guarantee applies only to deliveries within the U.S.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     Shipments tendered for delivery on holidays that are business days for FedEx (for example, Good Friday and Presidents Day) will be scheduled for delivery on that day if the recipient business is open. However, if the recipient business is known by FedEx to be closed due to the holiday, the shipments will be scheduled for delivery on the next business day the recipient is open, but the money-back guarantee will not apply.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.     If a delivery later than the original scheduled delivery time is requested by the shipper or recipient before the first delivery attempt is made, the delivery commitment for application of the money-back guarantee policy will be adjusted to account for the requested delivery time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.     If the shipper or recipient informed FedEx that the recipient location is closed on a certain day or at a certain time, or unavailable to accept delivery, the delivery commitment for application of the money-back guarantee policy will be the next business day.</p>
<p>C.    <b>Exceptions.</b> FedEx will not be obligated to refund or credit your transportation charges or convenient delivery option charge if: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     We provide you with proof of timely delivery, consisting of the date and time of delivery and, if applicable, the name of the person who signed for the shipment, or service-exception information reflecting that the failure to deliver timely resulted from circumstances described under the Liabilities Not Assumed section.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     The service failure resulted, in whole or in part, from any of the circumstances described under the Liabilities Not Assumed section.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     The shipper did not properly label the shipment in accordance with the FedEx Service Guide, including, without limitation, affixing the correct business name and contact name and deliverable address (number, street, city, state, and a five-digit ZIP code) and correctly placing the customer-specific FedEx SameDay City bar-code label on the package.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     The shipment contained special instructions, including, but not limited to, FedEx Delivery Signature Options or change in delivery commit time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.     There was an unexpected material increase in the number of packages tendered from your shipping location.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.     A charge for additional handling or address correction applied; see Rates in the FedEx Service Guide for details.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">7.     FedEx received a request to redirect the shipment from a delivery address to a Hold at Location address.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">8.     The package was unauthorized (see the Package/Shipment Restrictions [Size and Weight] section).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">9.  The shipment was undeliverable or returned.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">10.  The shipment contained hazardous materials.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">11.  The shipment was delayed due to an incorrect address or ZIP code or the unavailability or refusal of an appropriate or eligible person to accept delivery or sign for the shipment, including signatures obtained via FedEx Delivery Signature Options.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">12.  The shipment was delayed due to security or other regulatory delays, including permanent, regular, or daily security procedures at the recipient location.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">13.  The shipment was not properly prepared in accordance with DOT regulations and FedEx SameDay City requirements.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">14. The shipment was tendered for delivery via FedEx SameDay City Direct.</p>
<p>D.    <b>Refund or Credit Requests.</b> To qualify for a refund or credit due to a service failure, you must notify us of the service failure and request a refund or credit in compliance with the conditions listed below. If you do not comply with these conditions, you are not entitled to receive a refund or credit and cannot recover compensation for a service failure in any lawsuit.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     You may request a refund or credit due to a service failure by submitting the request via our telephone billing option at <a href="tel:18003995999">1.800.399.5999</a> (select option 4, then option 1 to leave a voice message or option 2 to speak with a live agent).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     Your notification of a service failure must include your FedEx tracking number and invoice number, if applicable.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     All requests for a refund or credit must be received via one of the approved channels within 15 calendar days of the invoice date or within 15 calendar days from the ship date if you are paying by credit card. All requests for adjustments must be made by an agent of the billed account.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     A partial payment against an invoice is not considered a request for invoice adjustment or notice of a refund request. A notification of the reason for an unpaid charge with your payment is not considered a request for an invoice adjustment or notice of a refund request if the reason relates to a service failure.</p>

<p>B.  Package Consolidators may submit claims for refunds or credits for shipping charges under the money-back guarantee policy.

<p>C.<b>  </b>In order for a Package Consolidator to receive packaging supplies from FedEx, the Package Consolidator must first enter into a Packaging and Pricing Agreement or a FedEx Authorized ShipCenter Agreement with FedEx.</p>
<p>D.  Package Consolidators may charge FedEx Retail Rates for FedEx shipping services, but they are not required to. Package Consolidators set their own rates for reselling FedEx services.</p>
<p>E.  FedEx assumes no liability, other than to the Package Consolidator, for lost, damaged or delayed shipments tendered to a Package Consolidator, as the Package Consolidator is the shipper of these packages. Package Consolidators are independently owned and operated businesses.</p>
<p>F.<b>  </b>See the Package Consolidator representative for information regarding rates and services and the terms and conditions of carriage. Inquiries or claims regarding shipments tendered to a Package Consolidator must also be directed to the Package Consolidator.<b></b></p>
<p>G.  As directed by FedEx, Package Consolidators must require a government-issued photo ID to validate the identity of their customer and must keep a record of the name and address on the ID of their customer for each package.  </p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>A.    You must comply with all applicable local, state and federal laws, including those governing packing, marking and labeling for all shipments.</p>
<p>B.    All shipments must be prepared and packed by the sender in such a manner as to be able to withstand the normal rigors of surface transportation and associated handling. Shipper must print and affix a FedEx SameDay City label to each package within a shipment.</p>
<p>C.    For guidelines on packaging specific commodities go to fedex.com/packaging. Items that cannot be packed into cartons (auto tail pipes, mufflers, tires, rims, and so on) must have all sharp edges and protrusions wrapped, and the address label must be secured using the tie-on tag or the tire/crate label provided by FedEx (or you may secure it by wrapping pressure-sensitive tape completely around the object). Briefcases, luggage, garment bags, aluminum cases, plastic cases, computer cartons or any other item whose outer finish might be damaged by adhesive labels, soiling, marking or other types of surface damage that is normal with ordinary care in handling should be placed in a protective container for shipment. FedEx is not responsible for damage to said items if not placed in a protective container. Exposed casters, wheels or rollers are prohibited and must be removed or packaged.</p>
<p>D.    Polystyrene foam coolers must be shipped inside a sturdy outer container unless tested and approved for acceptance by FedEx Packaging Design and Development. Information on how to submit your packaging for testing is available at fedex.com/packaging.</p>
<p>E.    If a shipment is refused by the recipient, leaks, or is damaged, the shipment will be returned to the sender, if possible. If the sender refuses to accept the returned shipment or it cannot be returned because of leakage or damage due to faulty packaging, the shipper is responsible for and will reimburse FedEx for all costs and fees of any type connected with the legal disposal of the shipment and all costs and fees of any type connected with cleanup of any spill or leakage.</p>
<p>F.    FedEx does not recommend the use of wet ice (frozen water) as a refrigerant. Shipments containing wet ice must be prepared to prevent the leakage of any liquid, regardless of package orientation. For additional wet-ice packaging requirements, refer to the packaging guide Packaging Perishable Shipments at fedex.com/packaging.</p>
<p>G.    <b>Fragile Articles/Orientation.</b> Packaging for all fragile articles (including, but not limited to, electronic and electrical devices, scientific testing equipment, fragile glass, crystal, porcelain, or china) should be preapproved by FedEx Packaging Design and Development prior to shipping.</p>
<p>For general packaging assistance, including packing, sealing and labeling tips and information on how to submit your packaging for testing or evaluation, go to fedex.com/packaging.</p>

If after the second delivery attempt the shipment is still not able to be delivered, the shipment will be stored overnight and returned to the shipper on the third business day. The foregoing notwithstanding, if the shipper desires the shipment to be returned on the same day, Same-Day Return To Sender may be selected at time of tender for a fee. Once selected any undeliverable shipment will be returned to the origin location the same day. For applicability of requests for returns, refer to the Same-Day Return to Sender section of this tariff. FedEx SameDay City return options are subject to all other terms and conditions provided in the FedEx SameDay City claims regulations, and as a whole, the tariff. The contents of a return shipment are subject to the same restrictions and prohibited-item limitations as the original shipment.</p>
<p>B.    Return to Sender must be selected at the time of order entry for return authorization if not delivered same day. The contents of a return shipment are subject to the same restrictions and prohibited-item limitations as the original shipment. FedEx shall not be liable for any damage to a shipment or claim arising out of the use of a return to sender option unless the shipment was lost during shipment or there was visible damage noted by the driver at time of delivery. FedEx shall not be liable for any concealed damage for items returned by selecting return to sender. Receipt of a shipment without written notice of damage on the delivery record is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the shipment was delivered in good condition. FedEx liability for any loss or damage arising out of an authorized return to sender shipment shall never exceed the actual amount of damage or the declared amount, whichever is lower. All other terms and conditions related to FedEx SameDay City claims regulations and, as a whole, the tariff, shall apply for shipments shipped through the use of a FedEx SameDay City return option.</p>
<p>C.    FOR FEDEX RETURNS, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE GIVEN TO FEDEX, THE PARTY THAT INITIATES A RETURN TO SENDER SHIPMENT TRANSACTION WITH FEDEX IS ULTIMATELY LIABLE FOR, WILL BE BILLED FOR, AND AGREES TO PAY, ALL CHARGES AND PICKUP FEES, INCLUDING ANY SPECIAL HANDLING FEES, REGARDLESS OF ANY PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CONTRARY, IF THE SENDER OR THIRD PARTY FAILS OR REFUSES TO PAY.</p>

<div class="fxg-rte      " style="color:;" data-emptytext="Rich Text"><p>An undeliverable shipment is one that cannot be delivered for reasons that include, but are not limited to, any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The recipient refuses to pay for a bill-recipient shipment.</li>
<li>The recipient refuses to accept the shipment prior to, during or after delivery.</li>
<li>The recipient’s delivery address cannot be located.</li>
<li>The shipment was addressed to an area not served by FedEx SameDay City.</li>
<li>The shipment’s contents or packaging are damaged to the point that rewrapping is not possible.</li>
<li>The shipment would likely cause damage or delay to other shipments or property or injury to personnel.</li>
<li>The shipment contains prohibited items.</li>
<li>The recipient’s place of business is closed.</li>
<li>No appropriate person was available to accept the shipment at a delivery location on the initial delivery attempt or reattempts.</li>
<li>The shipment was improperly packaged.</li>
</ul>
<p>A.    Undeliverable shipments may be returned via FedEx SameDay City service at the payer’s expense. Shipments will be returned via FedEx SameDay City service at no additional charge if the shipment is undeliverable because of damage to the shipment caused by FedEx. However, if the shipment is undeliverable for any other reason, FedEx reserves the right to assess return transportation charges and fees to the original payer, along with the original transportation charges and fees. If a package is marked “Bill Recipient” and is refused or returned to the sender, the billing is automatically changed to “Bill Sender.”</p>
<p>B.    Our money-back guarantee policy does not apply to undeliverable or returned shipments.</p>
<p>C.    FedEx reserves the right, at its sole discretion, and without notice, to sell, destroy or otherwise dispose of undeliverable shipments. By tendering a shipment, the shipper agrees to transfer and convey good and sufficient title of the contents of undeliverable shipments to FedEx, and agrees to pay any costs incurred in the sale, destruction or disposal thereof.</p>
